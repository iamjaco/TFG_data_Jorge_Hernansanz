","Coadministration has not been studied but is not recommended. Amiodarone is metabolised by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Abiraterone is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 and may increase concentrations of amiodarone. Therefore, coadministration is not recommended and selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product, with no or minimal metabolism via CYP2C8 should be considered. Close monitoring for amiodarone toxicity is recommended. Furthermore, the major metabolite of amiodarone, desethylamiodarone, is an inhibitor of CYPs 3A4 (weak), 2C9 (moderate), 2D6 (moderate), 2C19 (weak), 1A1 (strong) and 2B6 (moderate). Concentrations of abiraterone may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4. When coadministered with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, abiraterone AUC increased by 15%.

Abiraterone is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 in vitro but the in vivo effect has yet to be determined. However, a clinically relevant interaction is unlikely.",(See Summary)
389,Abiraterone,Trimipramine,"
Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied. Trimipramine is metabolised mainly by CYP2D6. Abiraterone is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and may increase concentrations of trimipramine. Coadministration should be approached with caution. If treatment with trimipramine cannot be interrupted, the dose should be reduced by at least 50% as trimipramine has a narrow therapeutic index.",(See Summary)

Do Not Coadminister
","
Very Low
",Coadministration is contraindicated if abiraterone is used for treatment of hormone-sensitive cancer. If used for hormone insensitive tumours the following information is applicable. Coadministration has not been studied and is unlikely due to the differing target populations. Based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Ulipristal is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. Abiraterone is an inhibitor of CYP2D6 (moderate) and CYP3A4 (in vitro). Since ulipristal does not have a narrow therapeutic index a clinically relevant interaction is unlikely.,(See Summary)

Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Valproic acid is primarily metabolised by glucuronidation (50%) and mitochondrial beta-oxidation (30-40%). To a lesser extent (10%) valproic acid is metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Valproic acid is also an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Abiraterone is an in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, but since these are minor pathways a clinically relevant effect on valproic acid exposure is not expected.",(See Summary)

Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Verapamil is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 1A2, 2C8 and 2C9. Abiraterone is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 (weak) and CYP3A4 (in vitro), and may increase concentrations of verapamil. Since CYP2C8 mediated metabolism is only a minor pathway and inhibition of CYP3A4 has only been demonstrated in vitro, a clinically relevant effect on verapamil exposure is not expected. Verapamil is also a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase abiraterone concentrations. When coadministered with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, abiraterone AUC increased by 15%. Therefore, an interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors is not likely to be clinically relevant.",(See Summary)

Furthermore, voriconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6. Concentrations of abiraterone may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4.

Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Approximately 90% of xipamide is excreted in the urine, mainly as unchanged drug (~50%) and glucuronides (30%). Furthermore, OAT1/3 are the major transporters of loop and thiazide diuretics. Secretion of these diuretics into the urinary tract by transporters in the proximal tubular cells is necessary for the diuretic effect in later tubule segments. Abiraterone does not inhibit or induce OATs. However, coadministration may increase the risk of hypokalaemia and monitoring may be required.",(See Summary)
