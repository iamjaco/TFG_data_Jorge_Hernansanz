A clinical adverse event (increased coagulation times) reported in a RCC patient receiving concomitant cabozantinib and warfarin was attributed to cabozantinib related inhibition of CYP-mediated warfarin metabolism. However, this event may reflect displacement of plasma protein-bound warfarin by cabozantinib. The same adverse event may occur when cabozantinib is combined with coumarins.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in an increasing number of renal cell cancer patients since the use of combined therapies consisting of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and antiangiogenic targeted agents.

","Coadministration has not been studied. Torasemide is metabolised mainly by CYP2C9. Cabozantinib does not inhibit or induce CYP2C9.

Cabozantinib metabolites inhibit renal transporters OAT1/3 in vitro and may decrease torasemide secretion and therapeutic effect.

399,Cabozantinib,Voriconazole,"
Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but should be approached with caution. Voriconazole is metabolised by CYP2C19 (major) and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Cabozantinib does not inhibit or induce these CYPs. However, voriconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6. Concentrations of cabozantinib may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Coadministration of cabozantinib and ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, decreased total cabozantinib clearance by 29% and increased cabozantinib AUC by 38%. The effect of voriconazole is expected to be comparable. Concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided, as cabozantinib is relatively toxic and can cause dose-related QT-prolongation. If coadministration is unavoidable, monitor closely for cabozantinib toxicity, including ECG assessment. Monitor cabozantinib plasma concentrations, if available. The dose of cabozantinib should be reduced if coadministration is unavoidable. Reduce the daily COMETRIQ dose by 40 mg (for example, from 140 mg to 100 mg daily or from 100 mg to 60 mg daily). Reduce the daily CABOMETYX dose by 20 mg (for example, from 60 mg to 40 mg daily or from 40 mg to 20 mg daily).

A clinical adverse event (increased coagulation times) reported in a RCC patient receiving concomitant cabozantinib and warfarin was attributed to cabozantinib related inhibition of CYP-mediated warfarin metabolism. However, this event may reflect displacement of plasma protein-bound warfarin by cabozantinib. Close monitoring of INR/PT is recommended.",(See Summary)
