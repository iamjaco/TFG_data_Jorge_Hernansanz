Epirubicin does not interact with this pathway. However, in 10 patients coadministration of epirubicin and verapamil increased epirubicin AUC. At steady state, epirubicin AUC did not differ significantly. Furthermore, dexverapamil increased the mean AUC of epirubicin and epirubicinol, the active metabolite of epirubicin, by 17% and 45% respectively. No a priori dose adjustment is necessary, but the bone marrow depressant effects of epirubicin may increase. Coadministration of epirubicin and verapamil may increase the risk of cardiotoxicity.
