Abemaciclib does not inhibit or induce CYPs. However, verapamil is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase concentrations of abemaciclib. In simulation studies, it was predicted that verapamil increases the AUC of abemaciclib by 2.28-fold. The AUC of the sum of abemaciclib and its active metabolites (M2, M18 and M20) increased by 1.63-fold.

Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but should be approached with caution. Voriconazole is metabolised by CYP2C19 (major) and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Abemaciclib does not inhibit or induce CYPs. However, voriconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6. Concentrations of abemaciclib may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4. Coadministration of clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, with abemaciclib increased abemaciclib AUC by 3.4-fold and increased the AUC of abemaciclib with its three active metabolites by 2.2-fold. A similar effect may occur after coadministration with voriconazole. Therefore, coadministration should be approached with caution. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 is recommended. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the dose of abemaciclib to 100mg twice daily when initially treated with 200 or 150 mg twice daily, or to 50 mg twice daily if the dose of abemaciclib is already reduced due to toxicity. Monitor closely for abemaciclib toxicity. Monitor abemaciclib plasma concentrations, if available. If a patient discontinues the use of voriconazole, increase the abemaciclib dose after 5-7 days to the dose used before starting voriconazole. Furthermore, voriconazole may cause QTc interval prolongation but no large QTc prolonging effect has been observed for abemaciclib. The net effect on QT prolongation has not been reported and it is unknown whether there is a warning in place. Therefore, ECG monitoring should be considered. ",See Summary

","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Approximately 90% of xipamide is excreted in the urine, mainly as unchanged drug (~50%) and glucuronides (30%). OAT1/3 are the major transporters of loop and thiazide diuretics. Secretion of these diuretics into the urinary tract by transporters in the proximal tubular cells is necessary for the diuretic effect in later tubule segments. Abemaciclib does not inhibit OAT1 and OAT3 at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, no effect on xipamide exposure is expected.",See Summary
