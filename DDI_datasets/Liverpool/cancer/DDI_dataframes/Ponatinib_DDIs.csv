Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Ponatinib does not inhibit or induce CYPs. However, concomitant use of ponatinib with anti-clotting agents should be approached with caution in patients who may be at risk of bleeding events. Severe haemorrhage, including fatalities, occurred in ponatinib-treated patients. Most haemorrhagic events, but not all, occurred in patients with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia.

2,Ponatinib,Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin),"
Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Aspirin is rapidly deacetylated to form salicylic acid and then further metabolised by glucuronidation (by several UGTs, UGT1A6 (major)). Ponatinib does not inhibit or induce CYPs or UGTs. However, ponatinib is highly protein bound (99.92%) and coadministration with aspirin has the potential for displacement of ponatinib from its protein binding sites, thus increasing free (i.e. active) ponatinib exposure. In a clinical study 50% of patients without coadministration of aspirin needed a dose reduction of ponatinib versus 70% of patients with coadministration of aspirin. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown. Note: Concomitant use of ponatinib with anti-clotting agents should be approached with caution in patients who may be at risk of bleeding events. Severe haemorrhage, including fatalities, occurred in ponatinib-treated patients. Most haemorrhagic events, but not all, occurred in patients with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia.

Ponatinib does not interfere with this elimination pathway. However, 5-FU binds to the enzyme thymidylate synthase resulting in DNA damage. This mechanism occurs in all fast dividing cells including bone marrow cells, resulting in haematological toxicity.

Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied. Ticagrelor undergoes extensive CYP3A4 metabolism and is a substrate of P-gp.

Furthermore, ticagrelor is a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase concentrations of ponatinib, although this is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Note: Concomitant use of ponatinib with anti-clotting agents should be approached with caution in patients who may be at risk of bleeding events. Severe haemorrhage, including fatalities, occurred in ponatinib-treated patients. Most haemorrhagic events, but not all, occurred in patients with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia.
