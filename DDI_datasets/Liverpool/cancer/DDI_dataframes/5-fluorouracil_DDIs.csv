","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but should be approached with caution. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. 5-fluorouracil may be an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and may, therefore, increase concentrations of acenocoumarol.

Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but should be approached with caution. Cimetidine is metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. 5-fluorouracil may be an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and may, therefore, increase concentrations of cimetidine. However, no formal interaction studies have been conducted. The clinical relevance of CYP2C9 inhibition is unknown but since multiple CYP enzymes are involved in this metabolic pathway, no clinically relevant effect on cimetidine exposure is expected. In vitro data indicate that cimetidine inhibits OAT1 and OCT2 but at concentrations much higher than the observed clinical concentrations. Cimetidine is also a weak inhibitor of CYPs 3A4, 1A2, 2D6 and 2C19. Cimetidine may increase the plasma concentrations of 5-fluorouracil, although 5-fluorouracil is not metabolised by CYPs.

Voriconazole is metabolised by CYP2C19 (major) and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. 5-fluorouracil may be an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and may, therefore, increase concentrations of voriconazole. However, no formal interaction studies have been conducted. The clinical relevance of this interaction, but since CYP2C9 is a minor pathway no clinically relevant effect on voriconazole exposure is expected. Voriconazole is also a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6. 5-fluorouracil is not metabolised by CYPs. 5-fluorouracil showed significant QTc prolongation at high doses especially with continuous infusions of fluorouracil. A thorough QT study has not been performed and the mechanism for the cardiotoxic effect is not fully understood. It is unknown whether a warning is in place. ECG monitoring should be considered.",See Summary
400,5-fluorouracil,Warfarin,"
Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration should be approached with caution. Warfarin is a mixture of enantiomers which are metabolised by different cytochromes. R-warfarin is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. S-warfarin (more potent) is metabolised by CYP2C9. 5-fluorouracil may be an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and may, therefore, increase concentrations of warfarin. However, no formal interaction studies have been conducted. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown. Furthermore, increased prothrombin time (PT) and internationalised normal ratio (INR) values have been reported in patients treated with warfarin in combination with 5-fluorouracil. In addition, case reports have observed increased adverse events (e.g. jaundice, epistaxis, hematemesis, hematuria and hematochezia) after coadministration of 5-fluorouracil with warfarin. If coadministered, monitoring for warfarin toxicity and INR/PT is recommended.",See Summary
401,5-fluorouracil,Xipamide,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Approximately 90% of xipamide is excreted in the urine, mainly as unchanged drug (~50%) and glucuronides (30%). OAT1/3 are the major transporters of loop and thiazide diuretics. Secretion of these diuretics into the urinary tract by transporters in the proximal tubular cells is necessary for the diuretic effect in later tubule segments. 5-fluorouracil is unlikely to interfere with this elimination pathway.",See Summary
402,5-fluorouracil,Zaleplon,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zaleplon is mainly metabolised by aldehyde oxidase and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. 5-fluorouracil does not interact with this metabolic pathway.,See Summary
403,5-fluorouracil,Ziprasidone,"
Potential Interaction
","
Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but should be approached with extreme caution. Approximately two thirds of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is by reduction, with less than one third by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4). 5-fluorouracil does not interact with this pathway. However, the product labels for ziprasidone contraindicate its use in the presence of other drugs that prolong the QT interval. 5-fluorouracil showed significant QTc prolongation at high doses especially with continuous infusions of fluorouracil. A thorough QT study has not been performed and the mechanism for the cardiotoxic effect is not fully understood. Therefore, it is unknown whether a warning is in place. Extreme caution is advised if coadministered. Monitor ECG closely if coadministration is unavoidable.",See Summary

Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zoledronic acid is not metabolised but is cleared from the plasma by uptake into bone and elimination via renal excretion. No pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with 5-fluorouracil.,See Summary

Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zolpidem is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 1A2. 5-fluorouracil may be an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and may, therefore, increase concentrations of zolpidem. However, no formal interaction studies have been conducted. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown, but since CYP2C9 is a minor pathway, no clinically relevant effect on zolpidem exposure is expected.",See Summary
