Potential Weak Interaction
","
Low
","Coadministration has not been studied. Alendronate is not metabolised and is cleared from the plasma by uptake into bone and elimination via renal excretion. Although no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected, alendronate should be separated from food or other medicinal products and patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product. Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in an increasing number of renal cell cancer patients since the use of combined therapies consisting of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and antiangiogenic targeted agents.

However, the European SPC for amphotericin states that concomitant use of amphotericin B and antineoplastic agents can increase the risk of renal toxicity, bronchospasm and hypotension. Furthermore, amphotericin B has a possible risk of QT interval prolongation. Therefore, caution is needed when sorafenib is co-administered with amphotericin B.

Although sorafenib is a moderate inhibitor of CYPs 3A4, 1A2 and 2C19 in vitro, no clinically significant effect on aprepitant is expected in vivo. During treatment, aprepitant is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase concentrations of sorafenib during the three days of coadministration. Since CYP3A4 mediated metabolism is only a minor metabolic pathway for sorafenib, a clinically relevant interaction is unlikely.
