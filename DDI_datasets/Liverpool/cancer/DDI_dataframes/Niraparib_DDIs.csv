No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Trimethoprim is primarily eliminated by the kidneys through glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Sulfamethoxazole is metabolised via CYP2C9. Niraparib does not interact with this elimination or metabolic pathway. Furthermore, trimethoprim is also a CYP2C8 inhibitor and in vitro data also suggest that trimethoprim is an inhibitor of OCT2 and MATE1. Niraparib is only very minimally metabolised through CYP enzymes and therefore no clinically significant effect on niraparib metabolism is expected.",(See Summary)
