Ciclosporin is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp, and inhibits CYP3A4 and OATP1B1. Concentrations of trametinib may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition but this is unlikely to be clinically relevant as CYP3A4 mediated metabolism is only a minor pathway. Due to the risk of additive haematological toxicity, haematological parameters should be monitored if coadministered with trametinib plus dabrafenib. No clinically relevant QTc prolonging effects were observed after trametinib monotherapy. However, the incidences of QTc ≥501 msec and QTc increase of >60 msec from baseline were significantly higher with the combination dabrafenib-trametinib (4% and 13%, respectively) compared with trametinib (2% and 3%, respectively) and dabrafenib (<1% and 3%, respectively) monotherapies.

Therefore, caution is needed when trametinib and dabrafenib are used concomitantly and are co-administered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.
