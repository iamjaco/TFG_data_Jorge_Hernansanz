Docetaxel does not inhibit or induce CYPs. Voriconazole is also a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6. Docetaxel concentrations may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition. Coadministration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased docetaxel AUC by 2.2-fold. A similar effect may occur with voriconazole. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the docetaxel dose by up to 50% and monitor closely for docetaxel toxicity.",See Summary
