399,Ipilimumab,Voriconazole,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Voriconazole is metabolised by CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4. Voriconazole is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Ipilimumab does not inhibit or induce CYPs and is not metabolised by CYP3A4.",(See Summary)
400,Ipilimumab,Warfarin,"
Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Warfarin is a mixture of enantiomers which are metabolised by different cytochromes. R-warfarin is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. S-warfarin (more potent) is metabolised by CYP2C9. Ipilimumab does not inhibit or induce CYPs. However, coadministration of warfarin and ipilimumab may increase the risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Patients who need concomitant anticoagulant therapy should be monitored closely.",(See Summary)

No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Approximately 90% of xipamide is excreted in the urine, mainly as unchanged drug (~50%) and glucuronides (30%). ",(See Summary)

No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zaleplon is mainly metabolised by aldehyde oxidase and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Ipilimumab does not interfere with these metabolic pathways.,(See Summary)

No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Approximately two thirds of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is by reduction, with less than one third by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4). Ipilimumab does not inhibit or induce CYPs. ",(See Summary)
