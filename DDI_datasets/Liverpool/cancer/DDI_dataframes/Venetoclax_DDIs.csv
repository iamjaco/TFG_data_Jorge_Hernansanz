No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Venetoclax does not inhibit or induce CYPs. However, in healthy volunteers (n=3), coadministration of venetoclax (400 mg single dose) and warfarin (5 mg single dose), increased AUC and Cmax of R-warfarin and S-warfarin by 18-28%.

Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied. Amiodarone is metabolised by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Venetoclax does not inhibit or induce CYPs.

Venetoclax concentrations may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by amiodarone. Coadministration should be avoided at initiation and during the dose-titration phase to minimise the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the venetoclax dose by at least 50% during the initiation, titration phase and steady daily dose. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome is recommended. The venetoclax dose that was used prior to initiation of amiodarone should be resumed 2 to 3 days after discontinuation of amiodarone.

Therefore, coadministration should be avoided during the initiation and dose-titration phase to minimise the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the venetoclax dose by at least 50% during the initiation, titration phase and steady daily dose. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome is recommended. Furthermore, after treatment aprepitant is a weak inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and UGT.

Furthermore, in a PBPK simulation, coadministration of venetoclax (400 mg single dose) and ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) increased venetoclax AUC and Cmax by 5.8- and 2.5-fold respectively.

A similar effect may occur with ranolazine. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of increased exposure to ranolazine should be considered. Furthermore, ranolazine is a weak inhibitor of P-gp, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concentrations of venetoclax may increase due to CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibition. PBPK simulations indicated no effect of weak CYP3A inhibitors (fluoxetine and fluvoxamine) on venetoclax Cmax or AUC.

A similar effect may occur with ranolazine. Coadministration of venetoclax and ranolazine at initiation and during the titration phase should be avoided. If coadministration is necessary, the US product label recommends reducing the venetoclax dose by at least 50%. Monitor closely for signs of toxicities.

No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Venlafaxine is mainly metabolised by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 3A4, 2C19 and 2C9. Venetoclax does not inhibit or induce CYPs. ",(See Summary)
396,Venetoclax,Verapamil,"
Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied. Verapamil is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 1A2, 2C8 and 2C9. Venetoclax does not inhibit or induce CYPs. However, verapamil is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase concentrations of venetoclax. In a PBPK simulation, coadministration of venetoclax (400 mg single dose) and verapamil (120 mg three times daily) increased venetoclax AUC and Cmax by 2.0- and 1.4-fold, respectively. Therefore, coadministration should be avoided at initiation and during the dose-titration phase to minimize the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the venetoclax dose by at least 50% during the initiation, titration phase and steady daily dose. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome is recommended. The venetoclax dose that was used prior to initiation of verapamil should be resumed 2 to 3 days after discontinuation of verapamil.",(See Summary)
397,Venetoclax,Vildagliptin,"
Potential Weak Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied. Vildagliptin is inactivated via non-CYP mediated hydrolysis. Vildagliptin is also a substrate of P-gp. Venetoclax may inhibit intestinal P-gp and BCRP at therapeutic doses. In healthy volunteers, coadministration of venetoclax (100 mg single dose) and the P-gp substrate, digoxin (0.5 mg single dose), increased digoxin AUC and Cmax by 9% and 35%, respectively. A similar effect may occur with vildagliptin. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of increased exposure to vildagliptin should be considered.",(See Summary)

399,Venetoclax,Voriconazole,"
Do Not Coadminister
","
Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but should be avoided. Voriconazole is metabolised by CYP2C19 (major pathway) and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Venetoclax does not inhibit or induce CYPs. However, voriconazole is an inhibitor of CYPs 3A4 (strong), 2C9 and 2C19. Concentrations of venetoclax may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4. In patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=11), coadministration of venetoclax (50 mg single dose) and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole (400 mg once daily for 7 days), increased venetoclax AUC and Cmax by 6.4- and 2.3-fold, respectively. A similar effect may occur with voriconazole. Coadministration is contraindicated at initiation and during the dose-titration phase to minimise the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. Although coadministration should be avoided after completion of the dose titration phase, if coadministration is necessary for patients who are on a steady daily dose of venetoclax, reduce the venetoclax dose by at least 75%. Close monitoring for signs of toxicities and symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome is recommended. The venetoclax dose may need to be further adjusted. The venetoclax dose that was used prior to initiating voriconazole should be resumed 2 to 3 days after discontinuation of voriconazole.",(See Summary)
400,Venetoclax,Warfarin,"
Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration should be approached with caution. Warfarin is a mixture of enantiomers which are metabolised by different cytochromes. R‑warfarin is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. S-warfarin (more potent) is metabolised by CYP2C9. Venetoclax does not inhibit or induce CYPs. However, in healthy volunteers (n=3), coadministration of venetoclax (400 mg single dose) and warfarin (5 mg single dose), increased AUC and Cmax of R-warfarin and S-warfarin by 18-28%. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the INR closely if venetoclax is coadministered with warfarin.",(See Summary)
