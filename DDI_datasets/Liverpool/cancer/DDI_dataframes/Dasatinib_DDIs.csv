Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied. Trazodone is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. Dasatinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase trazodone concentrations. As the clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown, monitoring may be required. In healthy volunteers dasatinib did not show relevant QT prolongation. However, grade 3 QT interval prolongation was reported in 1% of patients treated with dasatinib. Therefore, dasatinib should be administered with caution to patients who have or may develop prolongation of QTc. Hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia should be corrected prior to dasatinib administration. If coadministration is necessary, close monitoring including ECG assessment is recommended.",(See Summary)

Dasatinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase verapamil concentrations. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown. Verapamil is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and therefore could potentially increase dasatinib exposure. Concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided, or selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product, with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered. If coadministration is unavoidable, monitor closely for dasatinib toxicity and dose reduction should be considered.
