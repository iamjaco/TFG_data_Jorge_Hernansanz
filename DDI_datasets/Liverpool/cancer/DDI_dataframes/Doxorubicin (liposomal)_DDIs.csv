In one study, coadministration of doxorubicin and verapamil (different dosing regimens of I.V verapamil) resulted in no significant difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters of doxorubicin. However, another study observed a significantly higher doxorubicin AUC after coadministration with verapamil compared to doxorubicin alone. If coadministration is unavoidable, monitor closely for doxorubicin toxicity. Furthermore, doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is enhanced when coadministered with verapamil.

","Coadministration has not been studied but should be approached with caution. Voriconazole is metabolised by CYP2C19 (major) and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Doxorubicin does not inhibit or induce these CYPs. However, voriconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6. Doxorubicin concentrations may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition. After coadministration with ciclosporin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, doxorubicin and doxorubicinol AUC increased by 48% and 443%, respectively. A similar effect may occur after coadministration with voriconazole. Coadministration should be approached with caution.
