","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Vildagliptin is inactivated via non-CYP mediated hydrolysis and is a substrate of P-gp. Rucaparib is an in vitro inhibitor of P-gp. However, after coadministration with digoxin, a P-gp substrate, no clinically relevant effect was observed (digoxin AUC increased by 1.2-fold). A similar effect may occur with vildagliptin.",See Summary

399,Rucaparib,Voriconazole,"
Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but is not recommended. Voriconazole is metabolised by CYP2C19 (major) and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Rucaparib is a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2C19, 3A4 and 2C9, and may increase voriconazole concentrations. Coadministration of omeprazole, a CYP2C19 substrate, with rucaparib increased omeprazole exposure by 1.55-fold. A similar effect may occur with voriconazole. Monitoring for voriconazole toxicity may be required. Voriconazole is also a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6. In vitro, rucaparib is metabolised by CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition by voriconazole. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown but a significant effect on ricaparib exposure is not expected. Rucaparib and voriconazole may cause QTc interval prolongation. Therefore, coadministration is not recommended. If coadministration is unavoidable, ECG monitoring is recommended.",See Summary

","Warfarin is a mixture of enantiomers which are metabolised by different cytochromes. R-warfarin is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. S-warfarin (more potent) is metabolised by CYP2C9. Rucaparib is an inhibitor of CYPs 1A2 (moderate), 3A4 (weak) and 2C9 (weak), and may increase concentrations of warfarin. Coadministration with warfarin increased warfarin exposure by 1.49-fold. Monitoring of INR/PT andÂ warfarin toxicity may be required.",See Summary
401,Rucaparib,Xipamide,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Approximately 90% of xipamide is excreted in the urine, mainly as unchanged drug (~50%) and glucuronides (30%). Furthermore, OAT1/3 are the major transporters of loop and thiazide diuretics. Secretion of these diuretics into the urinary tract by transporters in the proximal tubular cells is necessary for the diuretic effect in later tubule segments. Rucaparib is an in vitro inhibitor of UGT1A1 and may increase xipamide concentrations. However, since glucuronidation is a minor pathway, no clinically relevant effect on xipamide exposure is expected. ",See Summary

","Coadministration has not been studied but is contraindicated. Approximately two thirds of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is by reduction, with less than one third by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4). Rucaparib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase ziprasidone concentrations. Furthermore, the product labels for ziprasidone contraindicate its use in the presence of other drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as rucaparib.",See Summary
