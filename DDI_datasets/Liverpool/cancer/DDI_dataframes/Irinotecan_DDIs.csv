After coadministration with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, SN-38 exposure increased by approximately 100%. A similar effect may occur after coadministration with voriconazole. If coadministration is unavoidable, monitor closely for irinotecan toxicity. A dose reduction of irinotecan should be considered. Monitor SN-38 plasma concentrations, if available.",See Summary
