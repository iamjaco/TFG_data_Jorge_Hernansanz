It cannot be excluded that pazopanib will have the same effect on transaminases during coadministration with other statins (e.g., atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin). In addition to implementing the recommended dose modification guidelines for pazopanib in patients who develop transaminase elevations, discontinuation of simvastatin should be considered to manage the risk of liver injury in cancer patients receiving both medications. ",(See Summary)

Potential Interaction
","
Low
","Coadministration should be avoided. The solubility of pazopanib decreases with increasing pH of the stomach. Coadministration with a proton pump inhibitor (esomeprazole) decreased pazopanib exposure by ~40%. If coadministration is clinically necessary, based on physiological considerations pazopanib should be administered just before the dose of lansoprazole as this when acid secretion is least inhibited. (Note, the European product label for pazopanib recommends that it should be taken without food once daily in the evening concomitantly with the proton pump inhibitor, whereas the US product label advises that a short-acting antacid should be considered in place of proton pump inhibitors.) Monitoring of pazopanib plasma concentrations should be considered, if available. Lansoprazole is mainly metabolised by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Pazopanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase lansoprazole concentrations but this is unlikely to be of clinical significance due to the wide therapeutic index of lansoprazole.",(See Summary)

405,Pazopanib,Zolpidem,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zolpidem is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP1A2. Pazopanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase zolpidem concentrations. However, since midazolam does not have a narrow therapeutic index, this is unlikely to be of clinical significance.",(See Summary)

407,Pazopanib,Zotepine,"
Potential Weak Interaction
","
Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied. Zotepine is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. Pazopanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and may increase zotepine concentrations. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown and monitoring may be required.,(See Summary)
408,Pazopanib,Zuclopenthixol,"
Potential Weak Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied. Zuclopenthixol is metabolized by sulphoxidation, N-dealkylation (via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) and glucuronidation. Pazopanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and may increase zuclopenthixol concentrations. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown and monitoring may be required.",(See Summary)
