","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Tropisetron is metabolised mainly by CYP2D6. Tropisetron is also a substrate of P-gp. Thalidomide does not inhibit or induce CYPs or P-gp. However, a thorough QT study with thalidomide has not been performed and it’s currently unknown if thalidomide has an effect on the QT interval. Thalidomide has a potential to induce bradycardia and coadministration with tropisetron should be approached with caution.

","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but is contraindicated. Ulipristal is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. Thalidomide does not inhibit or induce CYPs. However, an increased risk of venous thromboembolism was observed in patients taking thalidomide in combination therapy. Therefore, a switch to another effective contraception method is recommended. The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4-6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral contraception. The following can be considered to be examples of suitable methods of contraception: implant (please note: risk of infection or bleeding), levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (please note: risk of infection or bleeding), medroxyprogesterone acetate depot, tubal sterilization, sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only (vasectomy must be confirmed by two negative semen analyses) and ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e. desogestrel).",See Summary

400,Thalidomide,Warfarin,"
Potential Weak Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has been studied but care should be taken. Warfarin is a mixture of enantiomers which are metabolised by different cytochromes. R-warfarin is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. S-warfarin (more potent) is metabolised by CYP2C9. Thalidomide does not inhibit or induce CYPs. Coadministration of warfarin and thalidomide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin and did not affect the international normalized ratio. Warfarin may be indicated to treat the increased risk of thrombosis due to thalidomide administration. However, the use of thalidomide with thalidomide may increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore, care should be taken. Advise patients to observe for signs and symptoms of bleeding (e.g. petechiae, epistaxes, gastrointestinal bleedings) or bruising if coadministered. Furthermore, monitoring for INR may be required.",See Summary
