Imatinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase concentrations of carbamazepine. If coadministration is unavoidable, close monitoring for carbamazepine toxicity is recommended. Monitor carbamazepine plasma concentrations, if available. Furthermore, carbamazepine is an inducer of CYPs 2C8 (strong), 2C9 (strong), 3A4 (strong), 1A2 (weak), 2B6 and UGT1A1. Significant decreases in imatinib plasma exposure may occur due to induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Mean trough concentrations of imatinib decreased by ~66% in patients on carbamazepine (n=63) when compared to patients not receiving antiepileptic drugs (n=111). Decreased imatinib exposure can lead to decreased efficacy. Therefore coadministration should be avoided. Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product, with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered.

Potential Weak Interaction

","Coadministration has not been studied. Flucytosine is metabolised to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is further metabolised by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) to an inactive metabolite. Imatinib does not interfere with this elimination pathway. However, 5-FU binds to the enzyme thymidylate synthase resulting in DNA damage. This mechanism occurs in all fast dividing cells including bone marrow cells, resulting in haematological toxicity. Imatinib also induces haematological toxicity which could be enhanced by the use of flucytosine. Due to the risk of additive haematological toxicity, haematological parameters should be monitored if coadministered.",(See Summary)

In one patient within a clinical study, the AUC of a 350 mg dose of imatinib in combination with phenytoin was comparable to a dose of 85 mg imatinib monotherapy. A decrease in exposure can lead to decreased efficacy. Therefore, coadministration should be avoided. Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product, with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered.
