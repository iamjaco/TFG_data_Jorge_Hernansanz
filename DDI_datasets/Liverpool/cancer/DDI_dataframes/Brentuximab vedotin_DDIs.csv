399,Brentuximab vedotin,Voriconazole,"
Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but should be approached with caution. Voriconazole is metabolised by CYP2C19 (major) and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. MMAE (an active component of brentuximab vedotin) is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may slightly increase concentrations of voriconazole, but this is unlikely to be clinically relevant. However, voriconazole is strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6. Concentrations of MMAE and the incidence of neutropenia may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition. Coadministration of brentuximab vedotin with ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), increased MMAE AUC by 1.34-fold. The AUC of the antibody-drug conjugates was increased by 1.07-fold. A similar effect may occur with voriconazole. No a priori dose adjustment is recommended since the contribution of free MMAE to efficacy and safety is minimal. Patients who are receiving voriconazole concomitantly with brentuximab vedotin should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. If neutropenia develops, refer to dosing recommendations for neutropenia.",(See Summary)
400,Brentuximab vedotin,Warfarin,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Warfarin is a mixture of enantiomers which are metabolised by different cytochromes. R-warfarin is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. S-warfarin (more potent) is metabolised by CYP2C9. MMAE (an active component of brentuximab vedotin) is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may slightly increase concentrations of warfarin, but this is unlikely to be clinically relevant.",(See Summary)
401,Brentuximab vedotin,Xipamide,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Approximately 90% of xipamide is excreted in the urine, mainly as unchanged drug (~50%) and glucuronides (30%). Furthermore, OAT1/3 are the major transporters of loop and thiazide diuretics. Secretion of these diuretics into the urinary tract by transporters in the proximal tubular cells is necessary for the diuretic effect in later tubule segments. Brentuximab vedotin does not interfere with this elimination pathway.",(See Summary)
