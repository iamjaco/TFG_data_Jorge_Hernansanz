Significant decreases in sunitinib plasma concentrations may occur due to induction of CYP3A4. If coadministration is clinically necessary, the product labels for sunitinib recommend a dose increase in 12.5 mg increments up to a maximum of 87.5 mg per day, based on careful monitoring of tolerability. Monitoring of sunitinib plasma concentrations should be considered, if available.","Co-administration with potent CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided because it may decrease sunitinib plasma concentration. Administration of sunitinib with potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine) may decrease sunitinib concentrations. Combination with CYP3A4 inducers should therefore be avoided, or selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product, with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered.
