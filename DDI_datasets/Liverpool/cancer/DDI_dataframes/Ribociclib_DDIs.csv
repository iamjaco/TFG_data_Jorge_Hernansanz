401,Ribociclib,Xipamide,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Approximately 90% of xipamide is excreted in the urine, mainly as unchanged drug (~50%) and glucuronides (30%). Ribociclib is unlikely to interfere with this elimination pathway. Furthermore, OAT1/3 are the major transporters of loop and thiazide diuretics. Secretion of these diuretics into the urinary tract by transporters in the proximal tubular cells is necessary for the diuretic effect in later tubule segments. Although ribociclib is an in vitro inhibitor of OAT1/3, no clinically relevant effect on xipamide exposure is expected.",See Summary
402,Ribociclib,Zaleplon,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zaleplon is mainly metabolised by aldehyde oxidase and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Ribociclib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, but since CYP3A4 is a minor pathway, a clinically relevant effect is not expected.",See Summary
403,Ribociclib,Ziprasidone,"
Do Not Coadminister
","
Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but is contraindicated. Approximately two thirds of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is by reduction, with less than one third by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4). Ribociclib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase ziprasidone concentrations. Since CYP3A4 is a minor pathway, a clinically relevant effect on ziprasidone exposure is not expected. However, the product labels for ziprasidone contraindicate its use in the presence of other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Ribociclib has shown plasma concentration dependent QT prolongation. In patients, a mean change of 22.9 msec (90% CI: 21.6 – 24.1 msec) from baseline was estimated at a steady-state Cmax after administration of the recommended dose of 600 mg. Therefore, coadministration of ribociclib with ziprasidone, a QT prolonging drug, is contraindicated.",See Summary
404,Ribociclib,Zoledronic acid,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zoledronic acid is not metabolised but is cleared from the plasma by uptake into bone and elimination via renal excretion. Ribociclib is unlikely to interfere with this elimination pathway.,See Summary
405,Ribociclib,Zolpidem,"
Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but should be approached with caution. Zolpidem is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 1A2. A clinically relevant effect due to CYP1A2 inhibition is not expected since CYP1A2 is a minor pathway. However, ribociclib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase zolpidem concentrations. In healthy volunteers, coadministration of ribociclib and midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, increased midazolam exposure by 3.8-fold. A similar effect may occur with zolpidem. Therefore, coadministration should be approached with caution. If coadministration is unavoidable, monitor closely for zolpidem toxicity.",See Summary

In healthy volunteers, coadministration of ribociclib and midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, increased midazolam exposure by  3.8-fold. A similar effect may occur with zuclopenthixol.
