","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Approximately two thirds of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is by reduction, with less than one third by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4). An indirect effect of blinatumomab on CYPs may occur due to transient release of cytokines during the first days of therapy which can inhibit CYP450 metabolism. However, a clinically relevant interaction is unlikely.",(See Summary)
404,Blinatumomab,Zoledronic acid,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zoledronic acid is not metabolised and is cleared from the plasma by uptake into bone and elimination via renal excretion. Blinatumomab does not interact with this pathway.,(See Summary)
405,Blinatumomab,Zolpidem,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zolpidem is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 1A2. An indirect effect of blinatumomab on CYPs may occur due to transient release of cytokines during the first days of therapy which can inhibit CYP450 metabolism.

Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zuclopenthixol is metabolised by sulphoxidation, N-dealkylation (via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) and glucuronidation.
