Furthermore, carbamazepine is an inducer of CYPs 2C8 (strong), 2C9 (strong), 3A4 (strong), 1A2 (weak), 2B6 and UGT1A1.

A similar effect may occur with carbamazepine. Decreased axitinib exposure may lead to reduced efficacy. Coadministration is not recommended. If coadministration is unavoidable, the dose of axitinib should be increased gradually with careful monitoring of tolerability. Monitor axitinib concentrations, if available.

Therefore, concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended and selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product, with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered.

Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but should be approached with caution. Voriconazole is metabolized by CYP2C19 (major) and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Axitinib does not inhibit or induce CYPs 2C19, 2C9 or 3A4. However, voriconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6. Concentrations of axitinib may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4. Increased axitinib exposure may increase the risk of exposure-related toxicity. Coadministration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, and axitinib increased axitinib AUC by 2-fold. A similar effect may occur after coadministration with voriconazole. Therefore, concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended and selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product, with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered. If concurrent use is unavoidable, a dose reduction of axitinib is recommended: decrease axitinib dose by approximately 50%. Monitor axitinib plasma concentrations, if available.",(See Summary)
