4,Tivozanib,Alendronic acid,"
Potential Weak Interaction
","
Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Alendronate is not metabolised but is cleared from the plasma by uptake into bone and elimination via renal excretion. Although no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected, alendronate should be separated from food or other medicinal products and patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product. Furthermore, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in an increasing number of renal cell cancer patients, largely due to the use of combined therapies consisting of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as alendronic acid) and antiangiogenic targeted agents. This suggests that angiogenesis suppression might increase the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw when coadministered with bisphosphonates.",(See Summary)

Medicinal products and supplements should be similarly avoided prior to taking pamidronic acid. Fasting should be continued for at least 30 minutes after taking pamidronic acid. Furthermore, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in an increasing number of renal cell cancer patients, largely due to the use of combined therapies consisting of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as pamidronic acid) and antiangiogenic targeted agents.

Approximately two thirds of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is by reduction, with less than one third by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4). Tivozanib does not interfere with this pathway. However, the product labels for ziprasidone contraindicate its use in the presence of other drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as tivozanib.",(See Summary)
404,Tivozanib,Zoledronic acid,"
Potential Weak Interaction
","
Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Zoledronic acid is not metabolised but is cleared from the plasma by uptake into bone and elimination via renal excretion. Although no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected, zoledronic acid should be taken after an overnight fast (at least 6 hours) and before the first food or drink of the day. Medicinal products and supplements should be similarly avoided prior to taking zoledronic acid. Fasting should be continued for at least 30 minutes after taking zoledronic acid. Furthermore, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in an increasing number of renal cell cancer patients, largely due to the use of combined therapies consisting of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as zoledronic acid) and antiangiogenic targeted agents. This suggests that angiogenesis suppression might increase the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw when coadministered with bisphosphonates.",(See Summary)

No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zolpidem is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP1A2. Tivozanib does not inhibit or induce these CYPs.,(See Summary)
406,Tivozanib,Zopiclone,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zopiclone is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8. Tivozanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro but no clinically significant effect on zopiclone exposure is expected.,(See Summary)

408,Tivozanib,Zuclopenthixol,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zuclopenthixol is metabolised by sulphoxidation, N-dealkylation (via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) and glucuronidation. Tivozanib does not interact with this pathway.",(See Summary)
