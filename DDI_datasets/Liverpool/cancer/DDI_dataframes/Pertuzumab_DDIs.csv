Approximately 90% of xipamide is excreted in the urine, mainly as unchanged drug (~50%) and glucuronides (30%). Furthermore, OAT1/3 are the major transporters of loop and thiazide diuretics. Secretion of these diuretics into the urinary tract by transporters in the proximal tubular cells is necessary for the diuretic effect in later tubule segments. Pertuzumab does not interact with the renal excretion of xipamide.",See Summary
402,Pertuzumab,Zaleplon,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zaleplon is mainly metabolised by aldehyde oxidase and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Pertuzumab does not interact with this metabolic pathway.,See Summary
403,Pertuzumab,Ziprasidone,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Approximately two thirds of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is by reduction, with less than one third by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4). Pertuzumab does not interfere with this metabolic or elimination pathway.",See Summary
404,Pertuzumab,Zoledronic acid,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zoledronic acid is not metabolised but is cleared from the plasma by uptake into bone and elimination via renal excretion. Pertuzumab does not interact with this elimination pathway.,See Summary
405,Pertuzumab,Zolpidem,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zolpidem is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 1A2. Pertuzumab does not inhibit or induce CYPs.",See Summary
406,Pertuzumab,Zopiclone,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zopiclone is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8. Pertuzumab does not inhibit or induce CYPs.,See Summary
407,Pertuzumab,Zotepine,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zotepine is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. Pertuzumab does not inhibit or induce CYPs.,See Summary
408,Pertuzumab,Zuclopenthixol,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zuclopenthixol is metabolised by sulphoxidation, N-dealkylation (via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) and glucuronidation. Pertuzumab does not inhibit or induce CYPs or UGTs.",See Summary
