390,Dabrafenib,Tropisetron,"
Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Tropisetron is metabolised mainly by CYP2D6 and is a substrate of P-gp. Dabrafenib is an inducer of P-gp, but a clinically relevant interaction is unlikely. No clinically relevant QTc prolonging effects were observed after administration of dabrafenib (300 mg twice daily, two times the recommended dose). However, the incidences of QTc ≥501 msec and QTc increase of >60 msec from baseline were significantly higher with the combination dabrafenib-trametinib (4% and 13%, respectively) compared with trametinib (2% and 3%, respectively) and dabrafenib (<1% and 3%, respectively) monotherapies. Therefore, caution is needed when trametinib and dabrafenib are used concomitantly and are co-administered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. If coadministration with tropisetron is necessary, close monitoring including ECG assessment is recommended.",(See Summary)
