","Coadministration should be approached with caution. Warfarin is a mixture of enantiomers which are metabolised by different cytochromes. R-warfarin is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. S-warfarin (more potent) is metabolised by CYP2C9. Capecitabine is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and may increase concentrations of warfarin and, thereby, cause an enhanced anticoagulant activity. In patients with advanced/metastatic breast or colorectal cancer (n=4), coadministration of capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 orally twice daily for 14 days) and warfarin (20 mg single dose) increased S-warfarin AUC by 57%. Cmax of S-warfarin was unaffected. Only minor differences were observed in the PK parameters of R-warfarin. In three individual case reports, coadministration of capecitabine and warfarin resulted in increased INR (>8-10) in addition to rectal bleeding, haemorrhagic blisters, and subconjunctival bleeding amongst other presentations. It is recommended to closely monitor patients for anticoagulant response (INR or prothrombin time) and signs of bleeding, and adjust dose of warfarin accordingly.",(See Summary)
