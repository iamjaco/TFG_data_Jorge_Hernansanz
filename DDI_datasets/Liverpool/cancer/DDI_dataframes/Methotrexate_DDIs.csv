No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

2,Methotrexate,Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin),"
Do Not Coadminister
","
Very Low
","Coadministration should be avoided if acetylsalicylic acid is used at a dose > 100 mg daily. If acetylsalicylic acid is used at a dose < 100 mg daily, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aspirin is rapidly deacetylated to form salicylic acid and then further metabolised by glucuronidation (by several UGTs, major UGT1A6). Methotrexate does not inhibit or induce UGTs. However, methotrexate is partially bound to serum albumin as is acetylsalicylic acid. Acetylsalicylic acid may displace or be displaced by methotrexate. Therefore, the toxicity of both acetylsalicylic acid and methotrexate may be increased. Acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for analgesic or anti-rheumatic use may interact with the renal elimination of methotrexate. Coadministration of methotrexate and NSAIDs led to severe adverse events, including acute renal failure and pancytopenia, due to elevated and prolonged methotrexate concentrations. Therefore, coadministration of high dose acetylsalicylic acid (> 100 mg) should be avoided.",See Summary

Trimethoprim is a weak CYP2C8 inhibitor and in vitro data also suggest that trimethoprim is an inhibitor of OCT2 and MATE1. Sulfamethoxazole is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9. Coadministration of methotrexate with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may increase or exacerbate nephrotoxicity, particularly in patients with decreased renal function. An increased methotrexate toxicity, such as severe and unpredictable myelosuppression, stomatitis and neurotoxicity, has been observed after coadministration. Some adverse events were fatal in some cases. Furthermore, methotrexate is partially bound to serum albumin as is sulfamethoxazole. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may displace or be displaced by methotrexate. Changes in protein binding and tubular clearance of methotrexate, caused by competition with co-trimoxazole, resulted in a mean 66% increase in systemic exposure to methotrexate, and may explain the myelotoxicity often observed with the coadministration of the two drugs. In addition, orally administered trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may decrease the intestinal absorption of oral methotrexate and/or interfere with the enterohepatic circulation by inhibiting the bowel flora. Furthermore, bacterial metabolism of methotrexate may decrease.
