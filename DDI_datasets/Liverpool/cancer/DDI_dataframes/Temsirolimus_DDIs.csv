Significant decreases in the plasma concentrations of temsirolimus may occur due to CYP3A4 induction. In patients, coadministration of temsirolimus (once weekly I.V of 220 mg/m2) and a CYP3A4 inducer (carbamazepine or phenytoin) reduced temsirolimus Cmax and AUC by 36% and 15% and increased clearance by 24%.

For renal cell carcinoma patients, consider a dose increment from 25 mg/week to 50 mg/week with careful monitoring of tolerability.

Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied. Fosaprepitant is rapidly, almost completely, converted to the active metabolite aprepitant. Temsirolimus does not interact with this metabolic pathway. Aprepitant is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Temsirolimus does not inhibit or induce CYPs. However, during treatment aprepitant is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase concentrations of temsirolimus during the three days of coadministration. Therefore, coadministration is not recommended. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the temsirolimus dose to 50% of the original dose during the few days of coadministration. Monitor closely for temsirolimus toxicity. After treatment, aprepitant is a weak inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and UGT. Concentrations of temsirolimus may decrease due to weak induction of CYP3A4, but this is not considered to be clinically relevant.",(See Summary)

","Coadministration has not been studied but should be avoided. Fosphenytoin is rapidly converted to the active metabolite phenytoin. Phenytoin is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Temsirolimus does not interact with this pathway. However, phenytoin is a potent inducer of CYP3A4, UGT and P-gp. Concentrations of temsirolimus may decrease due to induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp. In patients with advanced solid tumours (n=11), coadministration of temsirolimus and a CYP3A4 inducer (carbamazepine or phenytoin) decreased temsirolimus Cmax and AUC by 36% and 15%, respectively, and increased clearance by 24%. Cmax and AUC of sirolimus decreased by 67% and 43%, respectively. Additionally, the sum AUC of temsirolimus and sirolimus decreased by 34%. A similar effect may occur with phenytoin. Therefore, coadministration should be avoided. If coadministration is unavoidable, monitor closely for temsirolimus efficacy. For renal cell carcinoma patients, consider a dose increment from 25 mg/week to 50 mg/week with careful monitoring of tolerability. After discontinuation of phenytoin treatment the CYP3A4 inducing effect may persist for over a week (mostly 2 weeks), so temsirolimus dose should be decreased accordingly.",(See Summary)

Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Valproic acid is primarily metabolised by glucuronidation (50%) and mitochondrial beta-oxidation (30-40%). To a lesser extent (10%) valproic acid is metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.

Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied. Verapamil is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 1A2, 2C8 and 2C9. Temsirolimus does not inhibit or induce CYPs and no effect on verapamil exposure is expected. However, verapamil is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and could potentially increase temsirolimus concentrations. The product labels for temsirolimus recommend to use with caution and that coadministration should be avoided with a temsirolimus dose higher than 25mg weekly. Additionally, coadministration with verapamil could increase the risk of angioneurotic oedema-type reactions. ",(See Summary)

Potential Weak Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied. Vildagliptin is inactivated via non CYP mediated hydrolysis and is a substrate for P-gp. Vildagliptin concentrations may potentially increase due to inhibition of P-gp by temsirolimus. Temsirolimus may induce hyperglycemia, which may require an increase in the dose of vildagliptin. Close monitoring is recommended.",(See Summary)

399,Temsirolimus,Voriconazole,"
Potential Interaction
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but may increase plasma concentrations of temsirolimus due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by voriconazole. The effect of voriconazole is expected to be comparable to ketoconazole (AUC of total temsirolimus plus active metabolite increased by 2.3-fold). Coadministration should be approached with caution. If combination is unavoidable, monitor closely for temsirolimus toxicity. For renal cell carcinoma patients, consider a dose reduction from 25 mg/week to 12.5 mg/week.",(See Summary)
