399,Pembrolizumab,Voriconazole,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Voriconazole is metabolized by CYP2C19 (major) and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Voriconazole is also a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6. Pembrolizumab does not interact with this pathway.",(See Summary)
400,Pembrolizumab,Warfarin,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Warfarin is a mixture of enantiomers which are metabolised by different cytochromes. R-warfarin is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. S-warfarin (more potent) is metabolised by CYP2C9. Pembrolizumab does not inhibit or induce CYPs. ,(See Summary)
401,Pembrolizumab,Xipamide,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Approximately 90% of xipamide is excreted in the urine, mainly as unchanged drug (~50%) and glucuronides (30%). Furthermore, OAT1/3 are the major transporters of loop and thiazide diuretics. Secretion of these diuretics into the urinary tract by transporters in the proximal tubular cells is necessary for the diuretic effect in later tubule segments. Pembrolizumab does not interact with this elimination pathway.",(See Summary)
402,Pembrolizumab,Zaleplon,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
",Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zaleplon is mainly metabolised by aldehyde oxidase and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Pembrolizumab does not interfere with these metabolic pathways.,(See Summary)
403,Pembrolizumab,Ziprasidone,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Approximately two thirds of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is by reduction, with less than one third by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4). Pembrolizumab does not interfere with these metabolic pathways. ",(See Summary)

Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zuclopenthixol is metabolised by sulphoxidation, N-dealkylation (via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) and glucuronidation. Pembrolizumab does not inhibit or induce CYPs or UGTs. ",(See Summary)
