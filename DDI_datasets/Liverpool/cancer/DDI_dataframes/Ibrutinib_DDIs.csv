Ibrutinib is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYPs at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, no effect on aprepitant exposure is expected. However, during treatment aprepitant is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase concentrations of ibrutinib during the three days of coadministration. Therefore, coadministration is not recommended. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the ibrutinib dose by 50% during the few days of coadministration (if ibrutinib is used for GVHD, a different dose modification should be used). Monitor closely for ibrutinib toxicity. Furthermore, after treatment aprepitant is a weak inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and UGT.

For administration routes other than oral, no clinically relevant interactions are expected, since the systemic exposure of ibrutinib is too low to inhibit systemic P-gp. Furthermore, azithromycin is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase ibrutinib concentrations. In a PBPK simulation (n=100), coadministration of ibrutinib (560 mg single dose) and azithromycin (500 mg once daily) increased ibrutinib AUC and Cmax by 1.5- and 1.4-fold, respectively.

Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied. Tropisetron is metabolised mainly by CYP2D6. Tropisetron is also a substrate of P-gp. The local effect of ibrutinib on P-gp inhibition in the gastro-intestinal tract is unknown. Therefore, monitoring for tropisetron toxicity, including ECG assessment, is recommended. Administration of tropisetron should be separated from ibrutinib administration as much as possible to minimise a potential interaction. For administration routes other than oral, no clinically relevant interactions are expected, since the systemic exposure of ibrutinib is too low to inhibit systemic P-gp.",(See Summary)

","Coadministration has not been studied. Verapamil is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 1A2, 2C8 and 2C9. Ibrutinib does not inhibit or induce CYPs at clinically relevant concentrations. However, verapamil is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase ibrutinib concentrations. In a single case report, coadministration resulted in ibrutinib toxicity (severe diarrhoea). If coadministration is clinically necessary, the EU product label recommends a dose reduction to 280 mg once daily for the duration of verapamil use. The US product label recommends a dose reduction to 140 mg once daily for the duration of verapamil use or to interrupt ibrutinib treatment. Close monitoring for ibrutinib toxicity is recommended and monitor ibrutinib plasma concentrations, if available. Note: if ibrutinib is used for GVHD, the FDA product label describes a different dose modification.",(See Summary)

Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but should avoided. Voriconazole is metabolised by CYP2C19 (major) and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Ibrutinib does not inhibit or induce CYPs at clinically relevant concentrations. However, voriconazole is an inhibitor of CYPs 3A4 (strong), 2C9 and 2C19. Concentrations of ibrutinib may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4. In a PBPK simulation (n=100), coadministration of ibrutinib (140 mg single dose) and voriconazole (200 mg twice daily) increased ibrutinib AUC and Cmax by 9.1- and 8.4-fold, respectively. If coadministration is absolutely clinically necessary, the US product label recommends reducing the ibrutinib dose to 140 mg once daily for the duration of voriconazole use or interrupting ibrutinib treatment. Close monitoring for ibrutinib toxicity is recommended and monitor ibrutinib plasma concentrations, if available.
