388,Palbociclib,Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole,"
No Interaction Expected
","
Very Low
","Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Trimethoprim is primarily eliminated by the kidneys through glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Palbociclib is unlikely to interfere with this elimination pathway. To a lesser extent (approximately 30%) trimethoprim is metabolised by CYP-enzymes (in vitro data suggest CYPs 3A4, 1A2 and 2C9). Palbociclib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase concentrations of trimethoprim. However, since this metabolic pathway has not yet been established and CYP mediated metabolism is only a minor pathway, a clinically relevant interaction is not expected. Furthermore, trimethoprim is also a weak CYP2C8 inhibitor with in vitro data suggesting it is an inhibitor of OCT2 and MATE1. Palbociclib does not interact with this pathway. Sulfamethoxazole is metabolised via and is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9. Palbociclib is not metabolised by and does not inhibit or induce CYP2C9.",See Summary

","Coadministration has not been studied. Tropisetron is metabolised mainly by CYP2D6 and is also a substrate of P-gp. Palbociclib is an inhibitor of P-gp in vitro at concentrations that are likely to only affect the P-gp present in the gut. Therefore, tropisetron concentrations may increase. Monitoring for tropisetron toxicity may be required. However, for administration routes other than oral (e.g. i.v. drugs), a clinically relevant interaction is not expected, since the systemic exposure of palbociclib is too low to inhibit P-gp.",See Summary

In healthy volunteers, coadministration of palbociclib and midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, under fasted conditions increased midazolam AUCinf by 61%. A similar effect may occur with verapamil. Therefore, care should be taken when verapamil is coadministered with palbociclib. Monitoring of blood pressure may be required. Furthermore, verapamil is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase concentrations of palbociclib. In a PBPK simulation, coadministration of verapamil and palbociclib resulted in an increased palbociclib AUC by approximately 40%. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown. In a single case report, coadministration of verapamil and palbociclib resulted in serious adverse events. Febrile neutropenia, grade 3 stomatitis with lip swelling, periorbital edema, and transaminitis were hypothesised from elevated levels of palbociclib secondary to verapamil’s inhibition of CYP3A4.

Palbociclib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase concentrations of voriconazole. However, since CYP3A4 is a minor pathway, no clinically relevant effect on voriconazole exposure is expected. Voriconazole is also a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6. Concentrations of palbociclib may increase due to strong inhibition of CYP3A4. In healthy volunteers, coadministration of palbociclib and itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased palbociclib AUC by 87%. A similar effect may occur with voriconazole. Therefore, coadministration should be approached with caution. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 is recommended. If coadministration is unavoidable reduce the palbociclib dose by 40%. Close monitoring for palbociclib toxicity is recommended. Monitor palbociclib plasma concentrations, if available.
