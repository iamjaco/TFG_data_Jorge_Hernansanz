Daclatasvir is only mild inducer of CYP3A4 and is unlikely to affect these pathways to any clinically significant extent. Coadministration of daclatasvir (60 mg once daily) and a once daily triphasic oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (35 µg) and another progestogen, norgestimate (0.180/0.215/0.250 mg for 7/7/7 days), was studied. There were no clinically relevant changes in the concentrations ethinylestradiol, norelgestromin or norgestrel.","Coadministration of daclatasvir (60 mg once daily) and a once daily triphasic oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (35 µg) and norgestimate (0.180/0.215/0.250 mg for 7/7/7 days) was studied. There was no clinically relevant effect on the concentrations of ethinylestradiol (AUC and Cmax increased by 1% and 11%), norelgestromin (AUC and Cmax increased by 12% and 6%) or norgestrel (AUC and Cmax increased by 12% and 7%). An oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol 35 μg and norgestimate 0.180/0.215/0.250 mg is recommended with daclatasvir. Other oral contraceptives have not been studied.Daklinza Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb, September 2014."
795,Daclatasvir,Procyclidine,No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Little is known about procyclidine metabolism but it is likely to be metabolised by P450 and glucuronidated. Daclatasvir is only a mild inducer of CYP3A4 and no clinically significant interaction is expected.,(See Summary)
796,Daclatasvir,Clofazimine,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Clofazimine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase daclatasvir concentrations to a modest extent however no dose decrease of daclatasvir would be required in this instance. [Note, the US Prescribing Information for clofazimine recommends to avoid clofazimine in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, and C) unless the benefit outweighs the risk.]",(See Summary)
