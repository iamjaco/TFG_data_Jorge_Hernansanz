Inactivation (minor, 10%) to the neurotoxic chloroacetaldehyde metabolite is performed mainly by CYP3A4. Daclatasvir is not expected to interact with these pathways.",(See Summary)
794,Daclatasvir,Norelgestromin/ethinylestradiol (patch),No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely and contraceptive efficacy is unlikely to be affected. Ethinylestradiol is mainly metabolized by hydroxylation with CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Norelgestromin is metabolized to norgestrel (possibly by CYP3A4). Daclatasvir is only mild inducer of CYP3A4 and is unlikely to affect these pathways to any clinically significant extent. Coadministration of daclatasvir (60 mg once daily) and a once daily triphasic oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (35 Âµg) and another progestogen, norgestimate (0.180/0.215/0.250 mg for 7/7/7 days), was studied. There were no clinically relevant changes in the concentrations ethinylestradiol, norelgestromin or norgestrel.","Coadministration of daclatasvir (60 mg once daily) and a once daily triphasic oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (35 Âµg) and norgestimate (0.180/0.215/0.250 mg for 7/7/7 days) was studied. There was no clinically relevant effect on the concentrations of ethinylestradiol (AUC and Cmax increased by 1% and 11%), norelgestromin (AUC and Cmax increased by 12% and 6%) or norgestrel (AUC and Cmax increased by 12% and 7%). An oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol 35 Î¼g and norgestimate 0.180/0.215/0.250 mg is recommended with daclatasvir. Other oral contraceptives have not been studied.Daklinza Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb, September 2014."
795,Daclatasvir,Procyclidine,No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Little is known about procyclidine metabolism but it is likely to be metabolised by P450 and glucuronidated. Daclatasvir is only a mild inducer of CYP3A4 and no clinically significant interaction is expected.,(See Summary)
796,Daclatasvir,Clofazimine,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Clofazimine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase daclatasvir concentrations to a modest extent however no dose decrease of daclatasvir would be required in this instance. [Note, the US Prescribing Information for clofazimine recommends to avoid clofazimine in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, and C) unless the benefit outweighs the risk.]",(See Summary)
