The clinical relevance of this is unknown. [Note, use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment as no pharmacokinetic data are available and in such patients reduced first pass metabolism may result in a relative overdose leading to CNS toxicity. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a safety alert over the use of high doses of loperamide from abuse and misuse with case reports of cardiac events including QT interval prolongation. Cardiac events are unlikely to occur when loperamide is dosed as an antidiarrheal even if coadministered with simeprevir. However caution is advised when loperamide is used at high doses for reducing stoma output, particularly as patients may be at increased risk of cardiac events due to electrolytes disturbances.]",(See Summary)
