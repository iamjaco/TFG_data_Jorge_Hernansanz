In study 1, tenofovir alafenamide AUC and Cmax increased by 32% and 3%, respectively. Tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 75%, 62% and 85%, respectively. Ledipasvir AUC and Cmin increased by 2% and Cmax increased by 1%. Sofosbuvir AUC increased by 5% while Cmax fell by 4%. Finally, the sofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007 AUC and Cmax increased by 8% and Cmin increased by 10%. In study 2, tenofovir alafenamide AUC and Cmax decreased by 14.3% and Cmax decreased by 9.5%.

Likewise, the increases in ledipasvir, sofosbuvir and GS-113007 are within safe limits. The authors therefore conclude that ledipasvir/sofosbuvir may be safely coadministered with rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir-alafenamide or elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, without dose adjustment.

Sofosbuvir is a prodrug and formation of its active metabolite is unlikely to be affected by comedications. Coadministration of sofosbuvir and an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and another progestogen, norgestimate, was studied. There were no clinically relevant changes in the concentrations of ethinylestradiol, norelgestromin or norgestrel.Â ","Coadministration of sofosbuvir and an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate increased ethinyl estradiol Cmax and AUC by 14% and 8%. The Cmax and AUC of norgestromin increased by 6% and 5%, whereas the Cmax and AUC of norgestrel increased by 18% and 19%. No dose adjustment of norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol is required when sofosbuvir and norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol are used concomitantly.Sovaldi Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences, January 2014."
794,Sofosbuvir,Norethisterone (Norethindrone) (POP),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as norethisterone is metabolised by CYP3A4 which is not affected by sofosbuvir. Sofosbuvir is a prodrug and formation of its active metabolite is unlikely to be affected by comedications.,(See Summary)
795,Sofosbuvir,Norethisterone (Norethindrone) (depot injection),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration with norethisterone as a depot injection has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is not anticipated and contraceptive efficacy is unlikely to be affected. Norethisterone is metabolised by CYP3A4. Sofosbuvir does not affect CYP enzymes. Sofosbuvir is a prodrug and formation of its active metabolite is unlikely to be affected by comedications.,(See Summary)
796,Sofosbuvir,Norethisterone (Norethindrone)/estradiol (HRT),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Norethisterone is metabolised by CYP3A4. Estradiol is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 and is glucuronidated. Sofosbuvir does not affect CYP enzymes. Sofosbuvir is a prodrug and formation of its active metabolite is unlikely to be affected by comedications.,(See Summary)
