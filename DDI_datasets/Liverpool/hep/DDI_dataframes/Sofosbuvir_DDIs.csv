In study 1, tenofovir alafenamide AUC and Cmax increased by 32% and 3%, respectively. Tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 75%, 62% and 85%, respectively. Ledipasvir AUC and Cmin increased by 2% and Cmax increased by 1%. Sofosbuvir AUC increased by 5% while Cmax fell by 4%. Finally, the sofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007 AUC and Cmax increased by 8% and Cmin increased by 10%. In study 2, tenofovir alafenamide AUC and Cmax decreased by 14.3% and Cmax decreased by 9.5%. Tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 27%, 17% and 33%, respectively. Ledipasvir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 79%, 65% and 93%, respectively. Sofosbuvir AUC and Cmax increased by 47% and 28%, respectively. GS-331007 AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 48%, 29% and 66%, respectively. Despite the increases in tenofovir exposure seen in this study, the mean tenofovir AUC is still five times lower than that seen with tenofovir-DF administration, so these exposures are safe. Likewise, the increases in ledipasvir, sofosbuvir and GS-113007 are within safe limits. The authors therefore conclude that ledipasvir/sofosbuvir may be safely coadministered with rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir-alafenamide or elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, without dose adjustment.

794,Sofosbuvir,Norethisterone (Norethindrone) (POP),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as norethisterone is metabolised by CYP3A4 which is not affected by sofosbuvir. Sofosbuvir is a prodrug and formation of its active metabolite is unlikely to be affected by comedications.,(See Summary)
795,Sofosbuvir,Norethisterone (Norethindrone) (depot injection),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration with norethisterone as a depot injection has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is not anticipated and contraceptive efficacy is unlikely to be affected. Norethisterone is metabolised by CYP3A4. Sofosbuvir does not affect CYP enzymes. Sofosbuvir is a prodrug and formation of its active metabolite is unlikely to be affected by comedications.,(See Summary)
796,Sofosbuvir,Norethisterone (Norethindrone)/estradiol (HRT),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Norethisterone is metabolised by CYP3A4. Estradiol is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 and is glucuronidated. Sofosbuvir does not affect CYP enzymes. Sofosbuvir is a prodrug and formation of its active metabolite is unlikely to be affected by comedications.,(See Summary)
