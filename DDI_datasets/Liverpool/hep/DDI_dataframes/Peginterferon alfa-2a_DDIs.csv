Medroxyprogesterone is metabolized by CYP3A4. The metabolism of conjugated estrogens is complex and involves CYP3A4 isoenzymes and glucuronidation in the liver. These pathways are not affected by peginterferon alfa-2a.,(See Summary)
794,Peginterferon alfa-2a,Medroxyprogesterone/estradiol (HRT),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Estradiol is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 and is glucuronidated. Medroxyprogesterone is metabolized by CYP3A4. Peginterferon alfa-2a may inhibit CYP1A2 to a limited extent which could potentially lead to a small increase in estradiol concentrations but this is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Peginterferon alfa-2a has no effect on CYP3A4 or UGTs.,(See Summary)
795,Peginterferon alfa-2a,Norelgestromin/ethinylestradiol (patch),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely and contraceptive efficacy is unlikely to be affected. Ethinylestradiol is mainly metabolized by hydroxylation with CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Norelgestromin is metabolized to norgestrel (possibly by CYP3A4). These pathways are not affected by peginterferon alfa-2a.,(See Summary)
