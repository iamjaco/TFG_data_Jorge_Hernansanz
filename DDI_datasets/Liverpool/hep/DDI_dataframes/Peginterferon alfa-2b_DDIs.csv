The pharmacokinetics of concomitant administration of methadone and PegIntron were evaluated in 18 PegIntron -naïve chronic hepatitis C subjects receiving 1.5 µg/kg PegIntron subcutaneously weekly. All subjects were on stable methadone maintenance therapy receiving greater than or equal to 40 mg/day prior to initiating PegIntron. Mean methadone AUC was approximately 16% higher after 4 weeks of PegIntron treatment as compared to baseline. In 2 subjects, methadone AUC was approximately double after 4 weeks of PegIntron treatment as compared to baseline.PegIntron US Prescribing Information, Merck Sharp & Dohme, January 2019."

689,Peginterferon alfa-2b,Tamoxifen,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolic profiles of both drugs there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4.

An increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy has been observed in one study when telbivudine and pegylated interferon alfa-2a were co-administered. Such increased risk cannot be excluded for other interferon alfa (pegylated or standard). Moreover, the benefit of the combination of telbivudine with interferon alfa (pegylated or standard) is not currently established.

The steady-state pharmacokinetics of telbivudine were unaltered following multiple dose administration in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2a.
