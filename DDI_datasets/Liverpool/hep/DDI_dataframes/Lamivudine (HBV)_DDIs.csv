0,Lamivudine (HBV),Abacavir,No Interaction Expected,NA,"No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed in clinical studies and the combination is frequently used in HAART for the treatment of HIV. Abacavir is metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase and UGT. The likelihood of metabolic interactions with lamivudine and other medicinal products is low due to the small extent of lamivudine hepatic metabolism (5-10%) and low plasma protein binding. Note, the bioavailability of lamivudine solution has been shown to be significantly reduced in a dose dependent manner by sorbitol which is present in liquid formulations such as abacavir oral solution.","The pharmacokinetics and safety of single doses of abacavir (600 mg), zidovudine (300 mg) and lamivudine (150 mg) were evaluated when given alone or with either or both of the other drugs to 13 HIV-infected subjects. Coadministration of abacavir with lamivudine (with or without zidovudine) decreased lamivudine AUC by ~15%, decreased Cmax by ~ 35% and delayed Tmax by ~1 h. While these changes are statistically significant, they are not considered to be clinically significant. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir when given alone, or with zidovudine or lamivudine, or with both zidovudine and lamivudine.Single dose pharmacokinetics and safety of abacavir (1592U98), zidovudine, and lamivudine administered alone and in combination in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Wang LH, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 1999, 43: 1708-1715.The effect of sorbitol on the single dose pharmacokinetics of 3TC oral solution was evaluated in 16 HIV-negative subjects. Sorbitol had a dose-dependent effect on 3TC PK with decreases of 28%, 52%, and 55% in Cmax and decreases of 20%, 39%, and 44% in AUC when co-administered with 3.2 g, 10.2 g, and 13.4 g sorbitol, respectively.Effect of sorbitol on 3TC PK after administration of lamivudine solution in adults.

However, due to high variability, the confidence intervals were quite wide. Plasma exposure of ribavirin did not appear to be affected by concomitant administration of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).Copegus Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, January 2019.In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. However, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were co-administered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HCV/HIV coinfected patients.Copegus US Prescribing Information, Genentech Inc, August 2015 (Discontinued).Caution should be taken in HIV-positive subjects co-infected with HCV who receive nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment (especially ddI and d4T) and associated interferon alfa/ribavirin treatment. In the HIV-positive population receiving an NRTI regimen, physicians should carefully monitor markers of mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis when Rebetol is administered.Rebetol Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2018.Ribavirin has been shown in cell culture to inhibit phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine, which could lead to decreased antiretroviral activity. However, in a study with another pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppress) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multidrug regimen in HIV/HCV co-infected subjects. Therefore, concomitant use of ribavirin with either of these drugs should be used with caution.Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Adding treatment with alpha interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient population. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anemia. Discontinuation of NRTIs should be considered as medically appropriate (see labeling for individual NRTI product). Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6).Rebetol US Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, October 2017.The effect of ribavirin (800 mg/day) on the plasma and intracellular PK of zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine was studied in HIV/HCV co-infected subjects receiving zidovudine plus lamivudine, or stavudine plus lamivudine. Plasma zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine and intracellular drug and endogenous triphosphates were measured at baseline without ribavirin and after 8-12 weeks of ribavirin co-administration. Plasma results showed no impact of ribavirin on nucleoside concentrations and ribavirin levels were consistent with previous data measured in the absence of the three NRTIs. Similar findings were observed for the deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine triphosphate analogues, when given with or without ribavirin, suggesting that ribavirin does not perturb the intracellular metabolism of zidovudine, lamivudine or stavudine.Effect of ribavirin on intracellular and plasma pharmacokinetics of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in patients with HCV/HIV co-infection: final results of a randomized clinical study.
