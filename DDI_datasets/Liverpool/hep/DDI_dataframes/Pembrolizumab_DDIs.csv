786,Pembrolizumab,Influenza vaccine,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. There is some evidence that vaccines may downregulate CYP3A4, but pembrolizumab does not interact with this pathway.",(See Summary)
787,Pembrolizumab,Adalimumab,Potential Weak Interaction,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Both pembrolizumab and adalimumab are primarily metabolised through catabolic pathways and drug-drug interactions are not expected. However, there may be a risk of additive haematological toxicity with coadministration. Routine monitoring of haematological parameters is recommended, as per standard care with pembrolizumab and adalimumab. ",(See Summary)
788,Pembrolizumab,Cyclophosphamide,Potential Weak Interaction,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Cyclophosphamide is activated (major pathway) to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide by CYPs 2B6 (major), 2C9 and 3A4. Inactivation (minor, 10%) to the neurotoxic chloroacetaldehyde metabolite is performed mainly by CYP3A4. Pembrolizumab is not expected to interact with these pathways. However, there may be a risk of additive haematological toxicity with coadministration. Routine monitoring of haematological parameters is recommended, as per standard care with pembrolizumab and cyclophosphamide. ",(See Summary)
789,Pembrolizumab,Medroxyprogesterone/estradiol (HRT),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Estradiol is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 and is glucuronidated. Medroxyprogesterone is metabolized by CYP3A4. Pembrolizumab is primarily metabolised through catabolic pathways and drug-drug interactions are not expected.,(See Summary)
790,Pembrolizumab,Medroxyprogesterone (oncology),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Medroxyprogesterone is metabolized by CYP3A4. Pembrolizumab is primarily metabolised through catabolic pathways and drug-drug interactions are not expected.,(See Summary)
791,Pembrolizumab,Cannabidiol (CBD),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Cannabidiol is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. Pembrolizumab does not interfere with these pathways.,(See Summary)
792,Pembrolizumab,Procyclidine,No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Little is known about procyclidine metabolism but it is likely to be metabolised by P450 and glucuronidated. Pembrolizumab does not interact with these pathways.,(See Summary)
793,Pembrolizumab,Alcohol,No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Alcohol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Acute alcohol use inhibits CYP2E1. Chronic use may induce CYP2E1 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4 but this is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Pembrolizumab does not interact with these pathways.,(See Summary)
794,Pembrolizumab,Clofazimine,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Clofazimine is largely excreted unchanged in the faeces, both as unabsorbed drug and via biliary excretion. Pembrolizumab does not affect this pathway. [Note, the US Prescribing Information for clofazimine recommends to avoid clofazimine in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, and C) unless the benefit outweighs the risk.]",(See Summary)
795,Pembrolizumab,Mesna,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically relevant drug interaction is unlikely. In vitro data suggest that mesna is a substrate of the OAT1, OAT3 and OAT4 renal transporters. Pembrolizumab is primarily metabolised through catabolic pathways and drug-drug interactions are not expected.",(See Summary)
796,Pembrolizumab,Carfentanil,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Carfentanil is expected to be metabolized by CYP3A4/5. Pembrolizumab is primarily metabolized through catabolic pathways and drug-drug interactions are not expected. However, carfentanil is an extremely strong opiate, reported to be up to 10,000 times more potent than morphine, and multiple deaths have resulted from its use.
