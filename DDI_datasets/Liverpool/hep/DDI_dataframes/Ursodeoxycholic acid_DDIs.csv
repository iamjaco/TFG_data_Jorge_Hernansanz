Destolit SmPC, Norgine, October 2018.A 62-year-old man on dapsone (50 mg, once daily) for dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) was prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid (450 mg, twice daily) for gall stones. Two weeks after beginning ursodeoxycholic acid he experienced a DH flare-up and dapsone was increased to 150 mg, once daily. He did not respond to treatment, so ursodeoxycholic acid was stopped and dapsone reduced to 100 mg, once daily. His DH improved considerably, allowing a further reduction of dapsone to 50 mg, once daily. Stroubou E, Dawn G and Forsyth A. Ursodeoxycholic acid causing exacerbation of dermatitis herpetiformis.
