A dosing strategy that would provide atazanavir and tenofovir exposures comparable to each drug when dosed alone was evaluated. The strategies employed were dosing the ATV (400 mg once daily) and TDF 12 hours apart and increasing the ATV dose to 600 mg once daily. The temporal 12-hour separation of ATV 400 mg resulted in a decrease in ATV Cmax, AUC, Cmin of 10%, 17%, and 28%, respectively and an increase in TDF Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 43%, 37%, and 38%, respectively.

J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2006, 41: 37-43.Nine cases have been reported of patients stable on efavirenz therapy who developed neuropsychiatric disturbances following the introduction of tenofovir to their antiretroviral regimens. The patients had been stable on efavirenz-containing regimens for a median duration of 31 months (range 5-58) during which no efavirenz related CNS effects were reported. Moderate to severe neuropsychiatric events occurred within 48 h of starting tenofovir in 5 patients, with symptoms developing in the remaining 4 patients after 2 weeks to 24 months after initiation of tenofovir. Treatment was changed in 6/9 patients; 3 switched from tenofovir to nevirapine, 2 to from tenofovir to zidovudine and one discontinued treatment. All 6 patients exhibited marked improvement in CNS intolerance. Of the 3 patients who remained on efavirenz and tenofovir, one had spontaneous progressive improvement within 2 weeks, but two had chronic persistent sleeping disorders.

Subjects continued their randomized dose of fosamprenavir±ritonavir for 14 more days (period 3), adding or removing tenofovir based upon its receipt in period 2. Plasma amprenavir and tenofovir pharmacokinetics were assessed on the last day of each period. Tenofovir Cmin, Cmax and AUC decreased by 12%, 25% and 15% after fosamprenavir coadministration and by 9%, 18% and 7% after fosamprenavir/ritonavir coadministration. Unboosted amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC increased by 31%, 3% and 7% after tenofovir coadministration; boosted amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC increased by 31%, 4% and 16% with tenofovir. No significant changes in ritonavir pharmacokinetics were observed. The authors conclude that the increases in amprenavir exposures and modest decreases in tenofovir exposures are unlikely to be clinically significant.Steady-state amprenavir and tenofovir pharmacokinetics after coadministration of unboosted or ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in healthy volunteers. Luber AD, Condoluci DV, Slowinski PD, et al. HIV Med, 2010,11(3): 193-199.This study was a prospective phase I crossover study in 30 healthy volunteers who received fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/100 or 1400/200 mg once daily) with or without tenofovir (300 mg once daily) for 14 days. Tenofovir was added or discontinued (cross over) for another 14 days, with pharmacokinetics being assessed on days 14 and 28. There was no effect of tenofovir on amprenavir AUC or Cmax in either regimen. Tenofovir led to significant increases in ritonavir AUC (32%) and Cmax (71%) when given with fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/200 mg. However, the authors conclude that no dose modification is necessary when combining fosamprenavir/ritonavir with tenofovir. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir plus tenofovir does not affect amprenavir pharmacokinetics: no effect of tenofovir. Kurowski M, Walli RK, Breske A, et al. AIDS, 2007, 21(10): 1368-1370.The interaction between TDF (300 mg once daily) and FPV/RTV (1400/100 mg or 1400/200 mg once daily) was investigated in healthy male subjects. The 24 h PK profiles for APV were similar for the two groups. There was no effect of TDF on APV AUC in either the 100 mg (GMR=0.99) or 200 mg (GMR=1.06) RTV groups. APV Cmax was unaffected by TDF in the 100 mg group (GMR=1.04), whereas the 200 mg group showed a non-significant increase (GMR=1.11). APV Ctrough showed non-significant increases in both groups (100 mg GMR=1.24, 200 mg GMR=1.02). There was a non-significant trend to higher RTV AUC in the 200 mg group. TDF monophosphate AUC and Cmax showed a non-significant trend to being lower in the 200 mg group, but with a higher Ctrough. Coadministration of TDF with FPV/RTV was generally well tolerated and the absence of relevant interactions suggests that no dose modification is necessary. Coadministration of tenofovir 300 mg once daily with fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/100 mg once daily or 1400/200 mg once daily does not affect amprenavir pharmacokinetics. Kurowski, M et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 10.The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of the FPV/RTV-TDF interaction in HIV+ patients (n=21) receiving FPV/RTV (700/100 mg twice daily) in combination with TDF (300 mg once daily). Median (range) trough concentrations were 1586 (867-2925) ng/ml for APV, 166 (30-615) ng/ml for RTV and 64 (31-226) ng/ml for TDF.

Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 24 subjects. Tenofovir Cmax was unaltered, but AUC and Cmin increased 32% and 51%. There was no change in lopinavir and ritonavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin.Viread US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, December 2018.Plasma concentrations of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=14) or nevirapine (400 mg once daily, n=13) were determined in HIV positive patients. Tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 50%, 33% and 72% higher, respectively, in the presence of lopinavir/ritonavir when compared to nevirapine. The authors suggest that observed increase in tenofovir exposure may involve intestinal P-gp inhibition by lopinavir and/or ritonavir. Pilot pharmacokinetic study of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infected patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF): Investigation of systemic and intracellular interactions between TDF and abacavir, lamivudine, or lopinavir-ritonavir. Pruvost A, Negredo E, Théodoro F, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2009, 53(5): 1937-1943.The pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was determined in 27 HIV-negative subjects. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir increase tenofovir AUC (32%), Cmax (15%) and Cmin (51%). Lopinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetics were unaffected by tenofovir (n=24). Clinical estimates of renal function were unaffected by administration of tenofovir alone or with lopinavir/ritonavir. The increase in tenofovir exposure is not believed to be clinically relevant based on the safety and efficacy of this combination in HIV-infected patients in long-term controlled clinical trials.

J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2006, 43: 278-283.The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) on the renal clearance of tenofovir was investigated in HIV-infected subjects receiving tenofovir (300 mg once daily) alone or in combination with LPV/r. Tenofovir clearance was 16% lower in subjects receiving LPV/r, consistent with a renal interaction between tenofovir and LPV/r. There was no difference in tenofovir-diphosphate concentrations when tenofovir was given alone or in combination.Effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on the renal clearance of tenofovir in HIV-infected patients. Kiser J, et al. 13th Conference on Opportunistic Infections and Retroviruses, Denver, February 2006, abstract 570.Significant increases in TDF plasma exposure have been reported when coadministered with Kaletra. This study looked at the interaction at the intracellular level by investigating the effect of LPV/RTV (400/100 once daily) on TDF-DP concentrations in HIV+ patients taking TDF (300 mg once daily). There was a trend to higher TDF-DP concentrations when used in combination with LPV/r. However, due to interpatient variability, this did not reach statistical significance. Mean ± SD TDF-DP concentrations were 181.4 ± 80.1 and 280.3 ± 181.8 fmol/106 cells, alone and in combination with LPV/RTV respectively. Since target concentrations have yet to be defined for TDF-DP, the possible consequences of this increase remain unknown. Possible interaction between tenofovir and boosted lopinavir; analysis at the intracellular level in HIV infected patients. Benech, H et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 34.The effect of tenofovir on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and ritonavir was investigated in 18 treatment experienced HIV+ patients. Lopinavir concentrations decreased in the presence of tenofovir (Cmin from 4.61 to 3.06 µg/ml; Cmax from 10.68 to 9.65 µg/ml). Decreases in ritonavir concentrations were also observed (Cmin from 0.63 to 0.35 µg/ml; Cmax from 1.02 to 0.72 µg/ml). Therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir when coadministered with tenofovir may be useful to indicate if individual dose modification of lopinavir and/or ritonavir is required.

As renal excretion has a minor role in clofazimine elimination, an interaction with tenofovir-DF via competition for renal elimination pathways is unlikely. [Note, the US Prescribing Information for clofazimine recommends to avoid clofazimine in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, and C) unless the benefit outweighs the risk.]",(See Summary)
789,Tenofovir-DF (HBV),Mesna,Potential Interaction,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro data suggest that mesna is a substrate of the OAT1, OAT3 and OAT4 renal transporters. Tenofovir is predominantly eliminated by active renal transport mechanisms. Coadministration with tenofovir and mesna may lead to competition for renal transporters and increased exposure of either drug. Close renal monitoring is advised.  Administration of another OAT1 inhibitor, probenecid, to healthy subjects significantly increased combined mesna and dimesna plasma exposure, while decreasing the renal clearance. A similar effect might be seen with tenofovir-DF. This may decrease the efficacy of mesna as a chemoprotectant, increasing the risk of ifosfamide- and cisplatin -induced toxicities.","Tenofovir disoproxil has not been clinically evaluated in patients receiving medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal pathway, including the transport proteins human organic anion transporter (hOAT) 1 and 3 or MRP. These renal transport proteins may be responsible for tubular secretion and in part, renal elimination of tenofovir. Consequently, the pharmacokinetics of these medicinal products, which are secreted by the same renal pathway including transport proteins hOAT 1 and 3 or MRP 4, might be modified if they are coadministered. Unless clearly necessary, concomitant use of these medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal pathway is not recommended, but if such use is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly.Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2019."
790,Tenofovir-DF (HBV),Carfentanil,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Carfentanil is expected to be metabolized by CYP3A4/5. Tenofovir-DF does not interact with this pathway. However, carfentanil is an extremely strong opiate, reported to be up to 10,000 times more potent than morphine, and multiple deaths have resulted from its use. Advise patients to avoid.",(See Summary)
791,Tenofovir-DF (HBV),Drospirenone/estradiol (HRT),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Estradiol is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 and is glucuronidated. Drospirenone is metabolised in part by CYP3A4. These pathways are not affected by tenofovir-DF.,(See Summary)
792,Tenofovir-DF (HBV),Desogestrel/ethinylestradiol (COC),No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is not anticipated and contraceptive efficacy is unlikely to be affected. Ethinylestradiol is mainly metabolized by hydroxylation with CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Desogestrel is a prodrug that requires activation to etonogestrel, by CYP2C9 (and possibly CYP2C19); the metabolism of etonogestrel is mediated by CYP3A4. These pathways are not affected by tenofovir-DF. No clinically significant drug interactions were observed when tenofovir-DF was coadministered with oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol/norgestimate).",(See Summary)
