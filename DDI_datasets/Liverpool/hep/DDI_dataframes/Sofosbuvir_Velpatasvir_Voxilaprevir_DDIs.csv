32,Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir/Voxilaprevir,Amiodarone,Do Not Coadminister,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Coadministration of amiodarone and sofosbuvir combined with another direct acting antiviral such as velpatasvir and voxilaprevir may result in serious symptomatic bradycardia. As cases are potentially life threatening, amiodarone should only be used in patients on sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir when other alternative anti-arrhythmic treatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated.","This interaction has not been studied. The effect on amiodarone, voxilaprevir, velpatasvir, and sofosbuvir concentrations is unknown. Use only if no other alternative is available. Close monitoring is recommended if this medicinal product is administered with Vosevi. Cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir used in combination with another DAA, is used with concomitant amiodarone with or without other medicinal products that lower heart rate. The mechanism is not established. The concomitant use of amiodarone was limited through the clinical development of sofosbuvir plus DAAs. Cases are potentially life threatening, therefore amiodarone should only be used in patients on Vosevi when other alternative anti-arrhythmic treatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. Should concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary, it is recommended that patients are closely monitored when initiating Vosevi. Patients who are identified as being at high risk of bradyarrhythmia should be continuously monitored for 48 hours in an appropriate clinical setting. Due to the long half-life of amiodarone, appropriate monitoring should also be carried out for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated on Vosevi. All patients receiving Vosevi in combination with amiodarone with or without other medicinal products that lower heart rate should also be warned of the symptoms of bradycardia and heart block and should be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they experience them.Vosevi Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, July 2017.Coadministration of amiodarone with Vosevi may result in serious symptomatic bradycardia. The mechanism of this effect is unknown. Coadministration of amiodarone with Vosevi is not recommended; if coadministration is required, cardiac monitoring is recommended. The effect on amiodarone, sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir concentrations is unknown. Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir)). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown. Coadministration of amiodarone with Vosevi is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative viable treatment options and who will be coadministered Vosevi: counsel patients about the risk of symptomatic bradycardia and cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment. Patients who are taking Vosevi who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above. Due to amiodarone’s long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting Vosevi should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above. Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion, or memory problemsVosevi US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, July 2017."

701,Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir/Voxilaprevir,Tenofovir-DF (HBV),Potential Interaction,NA,Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure due to inhibition of P-gp by velpatasvir and voxilaprevir. Tenofovir exposure (AUC and Cmax) increased by ~40% during co-treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and tenofovir-DF (with darunavir/ritonavir/emtricitabine). Patients receiving sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir concomitantly with tenofovir-DF should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions.,"Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir, especially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and a pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat). The safety of tenofovir disoproxil in the setting of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a pharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established. The potential risks and benefits associated with co-administration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir with tenofovir disoproxil given in conjunction with a boosted HIV protease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be considered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction. Patients receiving sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir concomitantly with tenofovir disoproxil and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil.Coadministration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (400/100/100 mg plus voxilaprevir 100 mg, once daily), darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily) and emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF (200/245 mg once daily) had no effect on sofosbuvir AUC but decreased Cmax by 30%; there was no change in AUC and Cmax of GS-331007.
