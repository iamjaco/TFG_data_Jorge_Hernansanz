The mechanism of this effect is unknown.,"Cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is used with amiodarone with or without other drugs that lower heart rate. The mechanism is not established. Cases are potentially life-threatening, therefore amiodarone should only be used in patients on ledipasvir/sofosbuvir when other alternative anti-arrhythmic treatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. Should concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary it is recommended that patients are closely monitored when initiating ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. Patients who are identified as being high risk of bradyarrhythmia should be continuously monitored for 48 hours in an appropriate clinical setting. Due to the long half-life of amiodarone, appropriate monitoring should also be carried out for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated on ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. All patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in combination with amiodarone with or without other drugs that lower heart rate should also be warned of the symptoms of bradycardia and heart block and should be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they experience them.Harvoni Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, August 2019. Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, as well as fatal cardiac arrest and cases requiring pacemaker intervention, have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease, may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.Coadministration of amiodarone with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered ledipasvir/sofosbuvir: • Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia• Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment. Patients who are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above. Due to amiodarone’s long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting ledipasvir/sofosbuvir should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above. Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, and confusion or memory problems.The effect of coadministration on amiodarone, ledipasvir, and sofosbuvir concentrations is unknown.Harvoni Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, August 2019."

Coadministration of doravirine (100 mg once daily) and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (90/400 mg once daily) increased doravirine AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 15%, 11% and 24%, respectively. This small increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Doravirine did not significantly alter ledipasvir or sofosbuvir exposures. Similarly, coadministration of lamivudine and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. However, coadministration of tenofovir-DF with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations, especially when used with an HIV regimen containing a pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat). Increased tenofovir exposure has also been shown with HIV regimens containing efavirenz and rilpivirine. The safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in these settings has not been established. The potential risks and benefits associated with coadministration should be considered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction. For patients receiving a boosted HIV protease inhibitor, consider an alternative HCV or antiretroviral therapy.

Ethinylestradiol Cmax and AUC increased by 40% and 20% with ledipasvir and by 15% and 9% with sofosbuvir; Cmin decreased by 2% with ledipasvir and 1% with sofosbuvir. For the metabolites of norgestimate in the presence of ledipasvir, norelgestromin Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 2%, 3% and 9%, whereas norgestrel Cmax increased by 3%, AUC decreased by 1% and Cmin was unchanged. In the presence of sofosbuvir, norelgestromin Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 7%, 6% and 7%, respectively and norgestrel Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 18%, 19% and 23%, respectively.Harvoni Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, August 2019."
