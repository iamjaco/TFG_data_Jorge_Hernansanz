Close monitoring is recommended if this medicinal product is administered with Epclusa. Cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir used in combination with another direct acting antiviral (DAA), is used with concomitant amiodarone with or without other medicinal products that lower heart rate. The mechanism is not established. The concomitant use of amiodarone was limited through the clinical development of sofosbuvir plus DAAs. Cases are potentially life threatening, therefore amiodarone should only be used in patients on Epclusa when other alternative anti-arrhythmic treatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. Should concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary, it is recommended that patients are closely monitored when initiating Epclusa. Patients who are identified as being at high risk of bradyarrhythmia should be continuously monitored for 48 hours in an appropriate clinical setting. Due to the long half-life of amiodarone, appropriate monitoring should also be carried out for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated on Epclusa.

Coadministration of a triphasic oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (0.025 mg) and another progestogen, norgestimate (0.180/0.215/0.25 mg), with sofosbuvir (400 mg once daily) or velpatasvir (100 mg once daily) was studied. There were no clinically relevant changes in the concentrations of ethinylestradiol, norelgestromin or norgestrel.","No dose adjustment of oral contraceptives is required. Coadministration of norgestimate/ ethinyl estradiol (norgestimate 0.180 mg/ 0.215 mg/ 0.25 mg/ ethinyl estradiol 0.025 mg) and sofosbuvir (400 mg once daily) had no effect on ethinyl estradiol Cmax, AUC or Cmin. There was no change in norelgestromin Cmax, AUC or Cmin; norgestrel Cmax was unaltered, but AUC and Cmin both increased by 20%. Coadministration of norgestimate/ ethinyl estradiol (norgestimate 0.180 mg/ 0.215 mg/ 0.25 mg/ ethinyl estradiol 0.025 mg) and velpatasvir (100 mg once daily) increased ethinyl estradiol Cmax by 40%, had no effect on AUC, and decreased Cmin by 17%. There was no change in the Cmax, AUC or Cmin of norelgestromin or norgestrel.Biktarvy Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc., November 2019.Based on drug interaction studies conducted with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, no clinically significant drug interactions have been observed with ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate. Coadministration of a once daily triphasic oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol (0.025 mg) and norgestimate (0.180/0.215/0.25 mg) with sofosbuvir (400 mg once daily) or velpatasvir (100 mg once daily) was studied. When administered with velpatasvir, ethinyl estradiol Cmax and AUC increased by 39% and 4%, but Cmin decreased by 17% (n=12); Cmax, AUC and Cmin of norelgestromin decreased by 3%, 10% and 8% and those of norgestrel decreased by 4%, 9% and 8%, respectively (n=13). When administered with sofosbuvir, ethinyl estradiol Cmax and AUC increased by 15% and 9%, but Cmin decreased by 1% (n=15); Cmax, AUC and Cmin of norelgestromin increased by 7%, 6% and 7% and those of norgestrel increased by 18%, 19% and 23%, respectively (n=15).Epclusa Prescribing Information, Gilead Science Inc., November 2019."
793,Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir,Norethisterone (Norethindrone) (POP),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely and contraceptive efficacy is unlikely to be affected. Norethisterone is metabolised by CYP3A4. These pathways are not affected by sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.,(See Summary)
794,Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir,Norethisterone (Norethindrone) (depot injection),No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration with norethisterone as a depot injection has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is not anticipated and contraceptive efficacy is unlikely to be affected. Norethisterone is metabolised by CYP3A4. These pathways are not affected by sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.,(See Summary)
795,Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir,Norethisterone (Norethindrone)/estradiol (HRT),No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Norethisterone is metabolised by CYP3A4. Estradiol is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 and is glucuronidated. These pathways are not affected by sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. However, velpatasvir is an inhibitor of OATP and in vitro studies have shown estradiol to be a high-affinity OATP substrate: the clinical significance of this is unknown. An OATP-mediated interaction is possible, which may increase exposure of estradiol to a limited extent. This is unlikely to be clinically relevant with short durations of treatment for hepatitis C.",(See Summary)

Norgestrel is a racemic mixture with levonorgestrel being biologically active. Levonorgestrel is metabolized by CYP3A4 and is glucuronidated to a minor extent.
