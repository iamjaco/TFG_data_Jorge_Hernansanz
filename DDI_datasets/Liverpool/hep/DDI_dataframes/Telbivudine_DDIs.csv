After a rise in HBV DNA, he was prescribed tenofovir-DF in addition to telbivudine. The patient began to experience myalgia, and after a month of worsening symptoms, telbivudine and tenofovir-DF were stopped and replaced by adefovir. Lab results indicated elevated ALT, AST, LDH and CPK. He went on to develop chest tightness and palpitation and was admitted to hospital. His urine was black and output was around 200 mL a day. Blood lactate was 20 mmol/L. His extremities were swollen and tender and he had lower limb muscle weakness and numbness. MRI revealed lower limb atrophy. The patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and lactic acidosis. His antiretroviral medication was switched to entecavir and he was treated with haemodialysis twice.

In addition, telbivudine does not alter the pharmacokinetics of adefovir dipivoxil, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or ciclosporin.Sebivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, April 2018Drug-drug interaction studies show that adefovir dipivoxil, cyclosporine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate do not alter Tyzeka pharmacokinetics.

After a rise in HBV DNA, he was prescribed tenofovir-DF in addition to telbivudine. The patient began to experience myalgia, and after a month of worsening symptoms, telbivudine and tenofovir-DF were stopped and replaced by adefovir. Lab results indicated elevated ALT, AST, LDH and CPK. He went on to develop chest tightness and palpitation and was admitted to hospital. His urine was black and output was around 200 mL a day. Blood lactate was 20 mmol/L. His extremities were swollen and tender and he had lower limb muscle weakness and numbness. MRI revealed lower limb atrophy. The patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and lactic acidosis. His antiretroviral medication was switched to entecavir and he was treated with haemodialysis twice. After a week of recovery, he was switched again to tenofovir-DF (due to HBV resistance) plus methylprednisolone. After five months, the patient was able to walk naturally again. The authors conclude a synergistic effect between telbivudine and tenofovir-DF occurred. They suggest that patients treated with both drugs should be closely monitored for muscular abnormalities and raised blood lactate.Case report: lactic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis during telbivudine and tenofovir treatment for chronic hepatitis B. Ying Y, Hu Y, Jin J et al. BMC Gastroenterol, 2018, 18(1): 45.Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg, once daily) and telbivudine (600 mg, once daily) was studied in 16 healthy volunteers, in a parallel study. Telbivudine Cmax and AUC decreased by ~16% and ~8%, respectively. Tenofovir Cmax increased by ~4% and AUC decreased by ~3%.
