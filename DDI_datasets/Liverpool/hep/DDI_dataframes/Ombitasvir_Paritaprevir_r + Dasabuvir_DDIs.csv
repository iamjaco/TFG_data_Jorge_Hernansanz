Ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and is predicted to increase bictegravir concentrations but to a modest extent as bictegravir is metabolized equally by CYP3A4 and UGT1A1. This increase is unlikely to be clinically significant; available dose exposure data, as well as data from phase 2 and phase 3 studies (48 weeks treatment), have shown a good safety profile with up to a 2.4 fold increase in bictegravir AUC. However, tenofovir alafenamide (the prodrug of tenofovir) is a substrate of P-gp and inhibitors of P-gp such as ritonavir are expected to increase the absorption of tenofovir alafenamide, thereby increasing systemic concentrations. The recommended dose of 10 mg tenofovir alafenamide with P-gp inhibitors is not possible with Biktarvy which is only available as a fixed dose combination containing 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide but it should be noted that tenofovir alafenamide has been associated with a large clinical safety profile.","The antiviral activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of short-term monotherapy with bictegravir was evaluated in a phase 1b, randomized, double-blinded, adaptive, sequential cohort, placebo-controlled study.

171,Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/r + Dasabuvir,Clopidogrel,Do Not Coadminister,NA,"Coadministration of clopidogrel and ritonavir-boosted regimens has been evaluated in clinical studies. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. The interaction between clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was investigated in 12 HCV-negative subjects in the presence of dasabuvir (250 mg single dose). Dasabuvir AUC increased by 289% and Cmax increased by 82% in the presence of clopidogrel and ritonavir when compared to ritonavir alone. The AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite decreased by 51% and 48% in the presence of ritonavir, with the average inhibition of platelet aggregation decreasing from 51% in the clopidogrel/dasabuvir phase to 31% in the clopidogrel/dasabuvir/ritonavir phase. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite both by 69% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). Subjects showed a comparable decrease in prasugrel’s active metabolite AUC (52% decrease), however this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. Given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of ritonavir-boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered. [Note, the European SmPC for clopidogrel contraindicates its use in severe hepatic impairment but the US Prescribing Information states no dose alteration.]","The impact of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel active metabolite (AM) and the pharmacodynamic effect was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Subjects ingested either placebo or clopidogrel (300 mg followed by 75 mg the two following days) alone and together with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) all in the presence of dasabuvir (250 mg single dose). Dasabuvir AUC increased by 289% and Cmax increased by 82% in the presence of clopidogrel and ritonavir when compared to ritonavir alone. Ritonavir significantly decreased the exposure of clopidogrel AM by 51% and average platelet inhibition significantly decreased from 51% without ritonavir to 31% with ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -27% to -12%). The maximal platelet inhibition by clopidogrel was also reduced from 60% to 40% during concurrent ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -29% to -11%). The authors conclude that patients receiving ritonavir are at risk for diminished clopidogrel response and consequently increased risk for atherothrombotic events if the two drugs are used concurrently. The authors recommend to avoid concomitant administration of clopidogrel with ritonavir.Clopidogrel increases dasabuvir exposure with or without ritonavir, and ritonavir inhibits the bioactivation of clopidogrel. Itkonen MK, Tornio A, Lapatto-Reiniluoto O, et al. Clin Pharmacol Ther, 2018, [epub ahead of print].The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites.

200,Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/r + Dasabuvir,Delamanid,Potential Interaction,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied. Delamanid is primarily metabolised by albumin to DM-6705; metabolism of DM-6705 to other metabolites is thought to involve pathways mediated by CYP enzymes, including CYP3A4. Coadministration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (lopinavir/ritonavir) increased DM-6705 exposure by 25-30%. QTc prolongation has been reported with delamanid (and is very closely correlated with the metabolite DM-6705). A similar increase would be expected with ritonavir when used with ombitasvir, paritaprevir and dasabuvir and caution is advised. If coadministration is considered necessary, frequent monitoring of ECGs is recommended, throughout the full delamanid treatment period (for example, at least fortnightly for the first month and if the QTc interval remains within normal range to reduce this to monthly thereafter).

Activation (major pathway) to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide is catalyzed by CYPs 2B6 (major), 2C9 and 3A4. Inactivation (minor, 10%) to the neurotoxic chloroacetaldehyde metabolite is performed mainly by CYP3A4. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and in vivo data suggest that it induces CYP2B6. The net impact of coadministration is difficult to predict as 2B6 induction may increase conversion of cyclophosphamide to the active metabolite, whereas CYP3A4 inhibition would block this pathway. Additionally, in theory, ritonavir could potentially reduce the risk of neurotoxicity and increase the amount of drug available for the activation pathway. If coadministration is necessary, careful monitoring of cyclophosphamide related side effects and therapeutic effectiveness is recommended.",(See Summary)
