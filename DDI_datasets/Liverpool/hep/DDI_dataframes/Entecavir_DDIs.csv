This may decrease the efficacy of mesna as a chemoprotectant, increasing the risk of ifosfamide- and cisplatin-induced toxicities.","Since entecavir is predominantly eliminated by the kidney, coadministration with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of either medicinal product.Baraclude Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, February 2019."
