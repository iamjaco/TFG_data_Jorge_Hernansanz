0,Ribavirin,Abacavir,Potential Interaction,NA,"Caution should be exercised when abacavir and ribavirin are coadministered. As abacavir and ribavirin share the same phosphorylation pathways a possible intracellular interaction has been postulated which could decrease ribavirin intracellular phosphorylated metabolites and result in a reduced likelihood of SVR. While some initial data suggested that HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving abacavir-containing regimens may be at risk of lower response to ribavirin therapy, this has not been confirmed in more recent studies. In addition, a well-designed study to evaluate the effects of abacavir on intracellular ribavirin triphosphate and plasma ribavirin concentrations failed to show any significant effect. Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred rarely in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving NRTI-containing HIV therapy and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anaemia.","Use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. Pharmacologically, Rebetol increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in vitro. This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). Conflicting findings are reported in literature on co-administration between abacavir and Rebetol. Some data suggest that HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving abacavir-containing ART may be at risk of a lower response rate to pegylated interferon/Rebetol therapy. Caution should be exercised when both medicines are co-administered.Caution should be taken in HIV-positive subjects co-infected with HCV who receive nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment (especially ddI and d4T) and associated interferon alfa/ribavirin treatment. In the HIV-positive population receiving an NRTI regimen, physicians should carefully monitor markers of mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis when Rebetol is administered.Rebetol Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2018.Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Adding treatment with alpha interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient population. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anemia. Discontinuation of NRTIs should be considered as medically appropriate (see labeling for individual NRTI product). Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6).Rebetol US Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, October 2017."

However, in a study with another pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppress) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multidrug regimen in HIV/HCV co-infected subjects. Therefore, concomitant use of ribavirin with either of these drugs should be used with caution.Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Adding treatment with alpha interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient population. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anemia. Discontinuation of NRTIs should be considered as medically appropriate (see labeling for individual NRTI product). Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6).Rebetol US Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, October 2017.The effect of ribavirin (800 mg/day) on the plasma and intracellular PK of zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine was studied in HIV/HCV co-infected subjects receiving zidovudine plus lamivudine, or stavudine plus lamivudine. Plasma zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine and intracellular drug and endogenous triphosphates were measured at baseline without ribavirin and after 8-12 weeks of ribavirin co-administration. Plasma results showed no impact of ribavirin on nucleoside concentrations and ribavirin levels were consistent with previous data measured in the absence of the three NRTIs. Similar findings were observed for the deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine triphosphate analogues, when given with or without ribavirin, suggesting that ribavirin does not perturb the intracellular metabolism of zidovudine, lamivudine or stavudine.Effect of ribavirin on intracellular and plasma pharmacokinetics of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in patients with HCV/HIV co-infection: final results of a randomized clinical study.

In study NR15961, patients concurrently treated with stavudine and interferon therapy with or without ribavirin, the incidence of pancreatitis and/or lactic acidosis was 3% (12/398). Ribavirin was shown in vitro to inhibit phosphorylation of stavudine. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. However, these in vitro findings raise the possibility that concurrent use of Copegus with stavudine might lead to increased HIV plasma viraemia. Therefore, it is recommended that plasma HIV RNA levels be closely monitored in patients treated with Copegus concurrently with stavudine. If HIV RNA levels increase, the use of Copegus concomitantly with reverse transcriptase inhibitors must be reviewed. No apparent evidence of drug interaction was observed in 47 HIV-HCV co-infected patients who completed a 12 week pharmacokinetic substudy to examine the effect of ribavirin on the intracellular phosphorylation of some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (lamivudine and zidovudine or stavudine).

In the HIV-positive population receiving an NRTI regimen, physicians should carefully monitor markers of mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis when Rebetol is administered.Rebetol Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2018.Ribavirin may antagonize the cell culture antiviral activity of stavudine and zidovudine against HIV. Ribavirin has been shown in cell culture to inhibit phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine, which could lead to decreased antiretroviral activity. However, in a study with another pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppress) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multidrug regimen in HIV/HCV co-infected subjects. Therefore, concomitant use of ribavirin with either of these drugs should be used with caution.Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Adding treatment with alpha interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient population. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anemia. Discontinuation of NRTIs should be considered as medically appropriate (see labeling for individual NRTI product).

He also had congenital von Willebrand disease type 1 and contracted hepatitis C after transfusion with an infected batch of lyophilized coagulation factor VIII. He was treated with interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU, 3 times a week, sub-cut) and ribavirin (600 mg, twice daily, for 12 months). After the initiation of antiviral therapy, his warfarin dose failed to maintain the target INR. His warfarin dose was increased progressively from 45 to 62.5 mg/wk over one month. This dose was gradually decreased to 57.5 mg/wk after weight loss. Suspecting a drug interaction, the authors rechallenged the patient with ribavirin (1000 mg, once daily, for 4 weeks) after successful eradication of hepatitis C. Warfarin was kept constant at 52.5 mg but the INR fell from 2.6 to 1.8. On discontinuation, the INR increased again, despite a dose reduction in warfarin.

Exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen used to treat HIV. Due to ribavirin's long half-life, any potential for interactions may persist for up to 2 months (5 half-lives) after cessation of ribavirin therapy.","The concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia. Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination ART regimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a known history of zidovudine induced anaemia. Ribavirin was shown in vitro to inhibit phosphorylation of zidovudine. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. However, these in vitro findings raise the possibility that concurrent use of Copegus with zidovudine might lead to increased HIV plasma viraemia. Therefore, it is recommended that plasma HIV RNA levels be closely monitored in patients treated with Copegus concurrently with this agent. If HIV RNA levels increase, the use of Copegus concomitantly with reverse transcriptase inhibitors must be reviewed. No apparent evidence of drug interaction was observed in 47 HIV-HCV co-infected patients who completed a 12 week pharmacokinetic substudy to examine the effect of ribavirin on the intracellular phosphorylation of some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (lamivudine and zidovudine or stavudine). However, due to high variability, the confidence intervals were quite wide. Plasma exposure of ribavirin did not appear to be affected by concomitant administration of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).Copegus Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, January 2019.In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. However, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were co-administered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HCV/HIV coinfected patients. In Study NR15961, patients who were administered zidovudine in combination with PEGASYS/Copegus developed severe neutropenia (ANC less than 500) and severe anemia (hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL) more frequently than similar patients not receiving zidovudine (neutropenia 15% vs. 9%) (anemia 5% vs. 1%). Discontinuation of zidovudine should be considered as medically appropriate.Copegus US Prescribing Information, Genentech Inc, August 2015 (Discontinued).Patients treated with Rebetol and zidovudine are at increased risk of developing anaemia; therefore, the concomitant use of Rebetol with zidovudine is not recommended.Â The exacerbation of anaemia due to Rebetol has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen used to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of Rebetol with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment (ART) regimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a known history of zidovudine induced anaemia.Caution should be taken in HIV-positive subjects co-infected with HCV who receive nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment (especially ddI and d4T) and associated interferon alfa/ribavirin treatment. In the HIV-positive population receiving an NRTI regimen, physicians should carefully monitor markers of mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis when Rebetol is administered.Rebetol Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2018.Ribavirin may antagonize the cell culture antiviral activity of stavudine and zidovudine against HIV. Ribavirin has been shown in cell culture to inhibit phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine, which could lead to decreased antiretroviral activity. However, in a study with another pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppress) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multidrug regimen in HIV/HCV co-infected subjects. Therefore, concomitant use of ribavirin with either of these drugs should be used with caution.Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Adding treatment with alpha interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient population. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anemia. Discontinuation of NRTIs should be considered as medically appropriate (see labeling for individual NRTI product). Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6).Rebetol US Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, October 2017."
