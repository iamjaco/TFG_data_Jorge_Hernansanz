Albiglutide is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes. However, as albiglutide slows gastric emptying it is advisable to take elbasvir/grazoprevir at least 1 hour before an albiglutide injection. [Note: this interaction is not specific for elbasvir/grazoprevir, but for any medication taken with albiglutide.]",(See Summary)
16,Elbasvir/Grazoprevir,Alemtuzumab,No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as alemtuzumab is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids by widely distributed proteolytic enzymes.,(See Summary)
17,Elbasvir/Grazoprevir,Alendronic acid,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but alendronate can be administered with elbasvir/grazoprevir and no dose alteration is required. Alendronate is not metabolised and is cleared from the plasma by uptake into bone and elimination via renal excretion. Although no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected, note that alendronate should be separated from food or other medicinal products and therefore should be separated from elbasvir/grazoprevir administration.

21,Elbasvir/Grazoprevir,Allopurinol,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as allopurinol is metabolised by xanthine oxidase.

23,Elbasvir/Grazoprevir,Aloe vera,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aloe vera is only a weak inhibitor of CYPs in vitro and therefore is unlikely to cause clinically significant interactions. It does not inhibit P-gp and there is no evidence to suggest it impacts UGTs.",(See Summary)
24,Elbasvir/Grazoprevir,Alogliptin ,No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

No dose adjustment is required.Zepatier Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, December 2018. The interaction between elbasvir or grazoprevir, or elbasvir/grazoprevir and acid reducing agents was evaluated in clinical studies, and no dose adjustments are needed when elbasvir/grazoprevir is used with antacids.Zepatier US Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc., June 2018."
27,Elbasvir/Grazoprevir,Alverine citrate,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on limited understanding of metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. However as alverine citrate affects gastric motility, an effect on the absorption of elbasvir/grazoprevir cannot be ruled out.

[Note: this interaction is not specific for elbasvir/grazoprevir, but for any medication taken with alverine citrate.]",(See Summary)
28,Elbasvir/Grazoprevir,Amantadine,No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Amantadine is only metabolized to a minor extent (principally N-acetylation) and is largely excreted unchanged in urine.,(See Summary)
29,Elbasvir/Grazoprevir,Ambrisentan,Potential Interaction,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied. Ambrisentan is a substrate for P-gp and is glucuronidated by several UGT isoenzymes, and also undergoes oxidative metabolism mainly by CYP3A4 (and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5 and CYP2C19). Ambrisentan concentrations may increase due to the additive effect of mild inhibition of P-gp by elbasvir and weak inhibition of CYP3A4 by grazoprevir. No effect of ambrisentan on elbasvir/grazoprevir is expected.",(See Summary)
30,Elbasvir/Grazoprevir,Amikacin,No Interaction Expected,NA,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as amikacin is largely excreted unchanged renally via glomerular filtration.,(See Summary)

35,Elbasvir/Grazoprevir,Amlodipine,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Amlodipine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Elbasvir/grazoprevir are metabolised by CYP3A4 and transported by P-gp. Although amlodipine may increase elbasvir and grazoprevir concentrations, this is unlikely to be of clinically significance. Concentrations of amlodipine may be increased due to weak inhibition of CYP3A4 by grazoprevir and mild inhibition of P-gp by elbasvir, but this is unlikely to be clinically significant.",(See Summary)
36,Elbasvir/Grazoprevir,Amobarbital,Do Not Coadminister,NA,Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended.

Apixaban is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4/5 (with minor contributions from CYPs 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2J2) and is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. Concentrations of apixaban may increase due to the additive effect of weak inhibition of CYP3A4 by grazoprevir, mild inhibition of P-gp by elbasvir, and inhibition of BCRP by elbasvir/grazoprevir. Close monitoring for increased apixaban side effects is recommended. No effect on elbasvir/grazoprevir is expected.",(See Summary)
47,Elbasvir/Grazoprevir,Aprepitant,No Interaction Expected,NA,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aprepitant is a substrate, a moderate inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Grazoprevir is only a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and no significant effect on aprepitant is likely. During treatment with aprepitant, CYP3A4 is inhibited although this is unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on elbasvir/grazoprevir due to the therapeutic window. Note, following cessation of aprepitant, elbasvir/grazoprevir concentrations may decrease due to short-term mild induction of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation, though any effect should be transient.",(See Summary)
