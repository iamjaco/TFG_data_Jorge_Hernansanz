364,Dolutegravir (DTG),Isoniazid,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Isoniazid is acetylated in the liver to form acetylisoniazid which is then hydrolysed to isonicotinic acid and acetylhydrazine. Dolutegravir is unlikely to interfere with this metabolic pathway. However, a study of coadministration of dolutegravir and isoniazid with rifapentine was ended early due to intolerance. In healthy volunteers receiving weekly isoniazid and rifapentine, the addition of dolutegravir resulted in flu-like symptoms and LFT elevations in 2 out of 4 patients (with higher than expected isoniazid concentrations), leading to study termination. Limited pharmacokinetic data suggested lower dolutegravir exposure. Intolerance is likely to be related to rifapentine (+/- healthy volunteer status) rather than isoniazid, since in the INSPIRING study, the addition of dolutegravir to daily isoniazid and rifampicin was well tolerated in 69 HIV-TB coinfected adults at 24 week analysis. ","An open-label, intrasubject drug interaction study in HIV-negative healthy volunteers comprised investigated the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir once daily alone and with once weekly isoniazid and rifapentine. Of 4 enrolled subjects (3 males, 1 female, age 22-46 years), 3 completed the study and 1 withdrew prior to the 3rd dose of isoniazid/rifapentine. The study was stopped prematurely due to the development of multiple AEs in 2 subjects. In both subjects, flu-like syndrome with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and fever (Grades 2 and 3) began ~8 hours after the last doses of dolutegravir, rifapentine, and isoniazid and lasted 24-48 hours. One subject required a 24-hour hospitalization for management of orthostatic hypotension (Grade 3). Transaminase elevations (Grades 2-4) occurred in both subjects. Exposure to rifapentine and its active metabolite were similar to reference PK data, but isoniazid exposure was 67-92% higher than expected in the 2 subjects who developed AEs. Limited pharmacokinetic data suggested isoniazid/rifapentine decreased dolutegravir AUC and Cmin by 46% and 74%. Given that flu-like syndrome was reported in <4% of subjects in studies of the efficacy of weekly isoniazid/rifapentine alone, these data suggest that co-administration of dolutegravir and weekly isoniazid/rifapentine should be avoided.Early termination of a PK study between dolutegravir and weekly isoniazid/rifapentine.

Of 4 enrolled subjects (3 males, 1 female, age 22-46 years), 3 completed the study and 1 withdrew prior to the 3rd dose of isoniazid/rifapentine.

One subject required a 24-hour hospitalization for management of orthostatic hypotension (Grade 3). Transaminase elevations (Grades 2-4) occurred in both subjects. Exposure to rifapentine and its active metabolite were similar to reference PK data, but isoniazid exposure was 67-92% higher than expected in the 2 subjects who developed AEs.

However, this interaction is not clinically relevant since the concentrations of free dolutegravir (pharmacologically active) are not decreased.","Concentrations of total and free dolutegravir were determined to elucidate the mechanism of the previously observed drug-drug interaction between valproate and dolutegravir. The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) were assessed in 3 HIV infected individuals in presence and absence of valproate (Depakine enteric; 30 mg/kg, divided in two daily oral doses administered during 14 days). Samples for total and free dolutegravir Ctrough plasma concentration were taken on day 0 (prior to coadministration of valproate) and on day 1, 7, 14 (all with valproate), and finally on day 42 (without valproate).

Importantly, all free dolutegravir concentrations were above the proposed in vitro EC90 value of unbound dolutegravir (0.9 µg/L). This study demonstrates that the reported decreased in total dolutegravir concentrations with concomitant use of valproate is due to protein displacement.
