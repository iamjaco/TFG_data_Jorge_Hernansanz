0,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),Abacavir (ABC),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration of abacavir (600 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (900/100 mg once daily) decreased abacavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 27%, 22% and 38%, respectively (n=19). Based on the different elimination pathways (abacavir metabolism is not mediated by CYP450), no significant interactions are expected with darunavir/ritonavir. However, studies are required to relate the change in plasma abacavir exposure to the active intracellular carbovir triphosphate.","Abacavir has also been shown in vitro not to inhibit CYP 3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Induction of hepatic metabolism has not been observed in clinical studies. Therefore, there is little potential for interactions with antiretroviral PIs.Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, December 2018.Coadministration has not been studied.

3,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),Acenocoumarol,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ritonavir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9 and darunavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease acenocoumarol concentrations. Monitor INR.,(See Summary)
4,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),Acetazolamide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as acetazolamide is primarily excreted unchanged via the kidneys.,(See Summary)
5,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),Aciclovir (Acyclovir),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as aciclovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1.

11,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),African Potato,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolic data there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. African potato was shown to inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp in vitro and to activate PXR suggesting that inhibition may occur initially followed by induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp when used for extended periods. However, coadministration of African potato with lopinavir/ritonavir in healthy volunteers did not result in significant pharmacokinetic changes suggesting that boosting by ritonavir could offset the inducing effect of African potato. Similarly, no significant effect is expected on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir/ritonavir.",(See Summary)
12,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),Agomelatine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Agomelatine is metabolised predominantly by CYP1A2 which is induced by ritonavir. Coadministration with darunavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease agomelatine exposure. Monitor clinical effect and increase dosage if needed.,(See Summary)
13,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),Albendazole,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 and the flavine-containing monooxygenase system are involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. Short term (2 doses) coadministration with ritonavir (200 mg) did not impact albendazole pharmacokinetics whereas long-term coadministration (8 days) decreased albendazole exposure likely due to ritonavir inducing effect. Daruanvir/ritonavir is unlikely to significantly affect albendazole exposure when used for a short duration treatment but may reduce the clinical effect of albendazole when used for a long duration treatment.,"In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400 mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and  its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir.Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

14,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),Albuvirtide,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Albuvirtide is a peptide which is eliminated by catabolism to its constituent amino acids. Based on data from studies with lopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations of darunavir/ritonavir may decrease but this is not expected to be clinically relevant. Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. However, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone (lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 37%, 33% and 35%, respectively; ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 38%, 39% and 28%, respectively). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 µg/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy. Furthermore, a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study) showed that albuvirtide + lopinavir/ritonavir was non-inferior to the standard second-line regimen lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine in HIV infected Chinese individuals suggesting that this interaction has no clinical consequences. In vitro human microsomal studies indicate that albuvirtide has no inducing properties on P450 enzymes. In addition, albuvirtide binds to <1% of serum albumin in the range of clinical concentrations, thus the observed decrease in lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations is unlikely to result from protein binding displacement. However, binding of the albuvirtide-albumin complex to the HIV protease inhibitor cannot be excluded.","Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 9 HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. Conversely, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone. The mean ratios (90% CI) of AUC, Cmax and Ctrough for lopinavir were 0.63 (0.49-0.82), 0.67 (053-0.86) and 0.65 (0.46-0.91). For ritonavir, AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 0.62 (0.42-0.91), 0.61 (0.38-0.99) and 0.72 (0.40-1.26).

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma viral load <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Non-inferiority was pre-specified with a margin of 12%. Interim analysis of 48 week data from 46 subjects in the albuvirtide group and 50 patients in the control group showed 80.4% patients in the albuvirtide group had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL versus 66.0% in the control group (difference 14.4%, 95% CI -3.0% -31.9%), meeting the non-inferiority criteria.Efficacy and safety of long-acting HIV fusion inhibitor albuvirtide in antiretroviral-experienced adults with HIV-1: interim 48-week results from the randomized, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority TALENT study.

When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. A similar effect cannot be excluded with darunavir/ritonavir. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Ciclesonide can be administered with darunavir/ritonavir without dose adjustment, but with close monitoring. There is a risk of steroid side effects occurring, particularly if a high dose is used, or in case of prolonged administration, or if used with another medicine containing corticosteroids. These side effects are also more likely during periods of physiological stress. Ciclesonide is a pro-drug activated by esterases in the lungs to des-ciclesonide which then undergoes CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 7 days) with orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 µg once daily) did not alter ciclesonide but resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the AUC and a 2-fold increase in the Cmax of des-ciclesonide. Ciclesonide is mainly absorbed by the lungs, has a high protein binding and a high clearance resulting in a lower potential to cause systemic effects compared to some other inhaled corticosteroids.

149,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),Clopidogrel,Do Not Coadminister,Low,"Coadministration of clopidogrel and boosted regimens has been evaluated in clinical studies. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite both by 69% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). In HIV-negative subjects (n=12), coadministration of clopidogrel and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 51% and 48%. Importantly, the decrease in clopidogrel’s active metabolite lead to insufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation in 44% of the patients treated with clopidogrel and ritonavir or cobicistat. Consistently, the study in HIV-negative subjects showed that the average inhibition of platelet aggregation was decreased from 51% (clopidogrel alone) to 31% (clopidogrel + ritonavir). Of interest, the study with HIV-infected patients showed a comparable decrease in prasugrel’s active metabolite AUC (52% decrease), however this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. The differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect is in line with clinical observations. Early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Taken together these data suggest that given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites. Marsousi N, Daali Y, Fontana P, et al. Clin Pharmacokinet, 2018 [epub ahead of print].The impact of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel active metabolite (AM) and the pharmacodynamic effect was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Subjects ingested either placebo or clopidogrel (300 mg followed by 75 mg the two following days) alone and together with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Ritonavir significantly decreased the exposure of clopidogrel AM by 51% and average platelet inhibition significantly decreased from 51% without ritonavir to 31% with ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -27% to -12%). The maximal platelet inhibition by clopidogrel was also reduced from 60% to 40% during concurrent ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -29% to -11%). The authors conclude that patients receiving ritonavir are at risk for diminished clopidogrel response and consequently increased risk for atherothrombotic events if the two drugs are used concurrently.

332,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),Heroin,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Darunavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide.

Ketoconazole increased imatinib exposure; however, ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) had no significant effect on imatinib exposure. Use with caution and monitor for imatinib related side effects. Imatinib may increase exposure of CYP3A4 substrates, such as darunavir.","Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg).

All treatments were with food for 6 days with steady-state pharmacokinetics following the morning dose on day 7. When given without ritonavir, ketoconazole increased darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 155%, 78% and 179%, respectively, compared with darunavir alone. In the presence of ritonavir, ketoconazole increased darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 42%, 21% and 73%, respectively, relative to darunavir/ritonavir treatment. Ketoconazole pharmacokinetics was unchanged by co-administration with darunavir alone, but AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 212%, 111% and 868%, respectively, during co-administration with darunavir/ritonavir compared with ketoconazole alone. The increase in darunavir exposure by ketoconazole was lower than that observed previously with ritonavir. However, a maximum ketoconazole dose of 200 mg/day is recommended if used concomitantly with darunavir/ritonavir.

389,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),Levodopa,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Enhanced levodopa effects including severe diskinesias were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. A similar effect cannot be excluded with darunavir/ritonavir. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Coadministration of ritonavir and mebendazole for 8 days significantly decreased mebendazole exposure (AUC 57%, Cmax 59%). Administration of mebendazole with cimetidine, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in increased serum levels of mebendazole. The effect of administering a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor on mebendazole pharmacokinetics is not known.","In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 1000mg mebendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. A trend towards an increase in mebendazole exposure after short-term intake of ritonavir was seen. However long-term administration resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC0-24 (57%) and Cmax (59%). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir.Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

556,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),Prasugrel,No Interaction Expected,Low,"Coadministration of prasugrel with a pharmacoenhancer has been evaluated in a clinical study. Prasugrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of prasugrel’s active metabolite by 52% and 43% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). However this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. Conversely, this same study showed that ritonavir or cobicistat significantly reduced both clopidogrel’s active metabolite exposure and inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. These data are in line with clinical observations as early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of ritonavir or cobicistat boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites.

A clinical study demonstrated that ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir increased activity of retinal dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

598,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),Rifabutin,Potential Interaction,Moderate,"Initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed that concentrations of rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) were significantly increased when combined with a boosted protease inhibitor, thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r and rifabutin (150 mg three times a week) resulted in rifabutin concentrations that were lower than those observed with rifabutin 300 mg once daily without protease inhibitors suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg 3 times a week and lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia). Coadministration in HIV-negative subjects increased darunavir AUC by ~50-60%. Based upon the safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir, the increase in darunavir exposure does not warrant a dose adjustment for darunavir/ritonavir.","Rifabutin is an inducer and substrate of CYP3A. An increase of systemic exposure to darunavir was observed when darunavir coadministered with 100 mg ritonavir was coadministered with rifabutin 150 mg (once every other day). Darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 53%, 39% and 68%, respectively. Based on the sum of the active moieties of rifabutin (parent drug + 25-O-desacetyl metabolite), rifabutin AUC increased by 55% and there was no significant change in Cmax. The interaction trial showed a comparable daily systemic exposure for rifabutin between treatment at 300 mg (once daily) alone and 150 mg (once every other day) in combination with darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) with an about 10-fold increase in the daily exposure to the active metabolite 25-O-desacetylrifabutin. Furthermore, AUC of the sum of active moieties of rifabutin (parent drug + 25-O-desacetyl metabolite) was increased 1.6-fold, while Cmax remained comparable. Data on comparison with a 150 mg (once daily) reference dose is lacking. A dosage reduction of rifabutin by 75% of the usual dose of 300 mg/day (i.e. rifabutin 150 mg once every other day) and increased monitoring for rifabutin related adverse events is warranted in patients receiving the combination with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir. In case of safety issues, a further increase of the dosing interval for rifabutin and/or monitoring of rifabutin levels should be considered. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate treatment of tuberculosis in HIV infected patients. Based upon the safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir, the increase in darunavir exposure in the presence of rifabutin does not warrant a dose adjustment for darunavir/ritonavir. Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, this dosage reduction of 75% is also applicable if patients receive rifabutin at doses other than 300 mg/day.Prezista Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, July 2018.Coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg every other day) and darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 11 subjects.

Baseline darunavir/ritonavir steady state pharmacokinetics was determined and rifampicin added for 7 days, then the dose of ritonavir was increased to 200 mg; 7 days later the dose of darunavir was increased; after another 7 days participants were crossed over to the alternative adjusted darunavir dose. Clinical adverse events, ALT, and bilirubin were monitored every 2 to 3 days during treatment with rifampicin. Seventeen PLWH were enrolled and started on study treatment before the study was stopped due to high rates of hepatotoxicity. Only 4 participants completed the study. Six (35%) of the participants were withdrawn for DAIDS grade 3 (n=3) or 4 (n=3) ALT elevations developing after 9-12 days of rifampicin; 3 participants were symptomatic. Hepatotoxicity resolved in all cases after withdrawal of study treatment and participants were successfully re-established on their standard of care ART regimen. Darunavir trough concentrations were below the protein-adjusted EC50 of 200 ng/mL in 2 participants in the darunavir/ritonavir 1600/200 mg once daily group in presence of rifampicin whereas no participant had trough concentrations below the EC50 in the darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg twice daily group.

632,Darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r),Sitagliptin,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated in urine as unchanged drug (active secretion by OAT3, OATP4C1, P-gp) and metabolism by CYP3A4 represents a minor elimination pathway. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Darunavir/ritonavir could potentially increase sitagliptin concentrations. However, this increase may not be clinically significant as the drug is mainly eliminated unchanged and has a large safety window.
