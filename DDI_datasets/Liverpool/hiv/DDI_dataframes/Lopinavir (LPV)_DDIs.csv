0,Lopinavir (LPV),Abacavir (ABC),Potential Weak Interaction,Low,"Coadministration of abacavir and lopinavir/ritonavir has no effect on lopinavir or ritonavir pharmacokinetics, but appears to decrease abacavir exposure by ~30%. The clinical significance of this is unknown.","Abacavir has also been shown in vitro not to inhibit CYP 3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Induction of hepatic metabolism has not been observed in clinical studies. Therefore, there is little potential for interactions with antiretroviral PIs.Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, December 2018.Abacavir concentrations may be reduced due to increased glucuronidation by lopinavir. The clinical significance of this reduced abacavir concentrations is unknown.Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012.Lopinavir induces glucuronidation and therefore has the potential to reduce abacavir plasma concentrations. The clinical significance of this potential interaction is unknown.Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.Plasma concentrations of abacavir (300 mg twice daily) with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=7) or nevirapine (400 mg once daily, n=5) were determined in HIV positive patients. Abacavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 40%, 46% and 29% lower, respectively, in the presence of lopinavir/ritonavir when compared to nevirapine. The authors suggest that the decrease in exposure of abacavir is due to induction of glucuronidation by ritonavir and/or lopinavir.Pilot pharmacokinetic study of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infected patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF): Investigation of systemic and intracellular interactions between TDF and abacavir, lamivudine, or lopinavir-ritonavir.

1,Lopinavir (LPV),Acamprosate,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acamprosate is eliminated unchanged in the urine.,(See Summary)
2,Lopinavir (LPV),Acarbose,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely.

3,Lopinavir (LPV),Acenocoumarol,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ritonavir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9. Lopinavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease acenocoumarol concentrations. Monitor INR.,(See Summary)
4,Lopinavir (LPV),Acetazolamide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acetazolamide is primarily excreted unchanged via the kidneys, there is therefore little potential for interaction with lopinavir via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.",(See Summary)
5,Lopinavir (LPV),Aciclovir (Acyclovir),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as aciclovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1.,(See Summary)

7,Lopinavir (LPV),Aclidinium bromide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aclidinium bromide is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed (non-enzymatic and enzymatic transformation by esterases and butylrylcholineesterases) to its pharmacologically inactive metabolites with only a minor role for CYP metabolism.,(See Summary)
8,Lopinavir (LPV),Adalimumab,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Adalimumab is a monoclonal IgG antibody. Elimination is similar to endogenous IgG and occurs primarily via proteolytic catabolism throughout the body.,(See Summary)

10,Lopinavir (LPV),Adrenaline (Epinephrine),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated, mostly in the liver by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO).

11,Lopinavir (LPV),African Potato,No Interaction Expected,Moderate,"Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) and African potato was studied in 16 HIV-negative subjects. Relative to repeated administration of lopinavir/ritonavir alone, steady-state Cmax and AUC of lopinavir remained unchanged following concomitant administration of multiple-dose African potato. These results suggest that inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir offsets any inducing effect of African potato on CYP3A4 expected when used for extended periods. ","Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) and African potato was studied in 16 HIV-negative subjects. Relative to repeated administration of lopinavir/ritonavir alone, steady-state Cmax and AUC of lopinavir remained unchanged following concomitant administration of multiple-dose African potato.Co-administration of a commonly used Zimbabwean herbal treatment (African potato) does not alter the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir.

12,Lopinavir (LPV),Agomelatine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Agomelatine is metabolised predominantly by CYP1A2 which is induced by ritonavir. Coadministration with lopinavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease agomelatine exposure. Monitor clinical effect and increase dosage if needed. ,(See Summary)
13,Lopinavir (LPV),Albendazole,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 and the flavine-containing monooxygenase system are involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. Short term (2 doses) coadministration with ritonavir (200 mg) did not impact albendazole pharmacokinetics whereas long-term coadministration (8 days) decreased albendazole exposure likely due to ritonavir inducing effect. Lopinavir/ritonavir is unlikely to significantly affect albendazole exposure when used for a short duration treatment but may reduce the clinical effect of albendazole when used for a long duration treatment.,"In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400 mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and  its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

14,Lopinavir (LPV),Albuvirtide,Potential Weak Interaction,Low,"Albuvirtide is a peptide which is eliminated by catabolism to its constituent amino acids. Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. However, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone (lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 37%, 33% and 35%, respectively; ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 38%, 39% and 28%, respectively). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 µg/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy. Furthermore, a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study) showed that albuvirtide + lopinavir/ritonavir was non-inferior to the standard second-line regimen lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine in HIV infected Chinese individuals suggesting that this interaction has no clinical consequences. In vitro human microsomal studies indicate that albuvirtide has no inducing properties on P450 enzymes. In addition, albuvirtide binds to <1% of serum albumin in the range of clinical concentrations, thus the observed decrease in lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations is unlikely to result from protein binding displacement. However, binding of the albuvirtide-albumin complex to the HIV protease inhibitor cannot be excluded.","Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 9 HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. Conversely, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone. The mean ratios (90% CI) of AUC, Cmax and Ctrough for lopinavir were 0.63 (0.49-0.82), 0.67 (053-0.86) and 0.65 (0.46-0.91). For ritonavir, AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 0.62 (0.42-0.91), 0.61 (0.38-0.99) and 0.72 (0.40-1.26). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 ug/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy.Evaluation of pharmacokinetic interactions between long-acting HIV-1 fusion inhibitor albuvirtide and lopinavir/ritonavir, in HIV-infected subjects, combined with clinical study and simulation results.

Xenobiotica. 2017, 47(2): 133-143.The safety and efficacy of albuvirtide plus lopinavir-ritonavir in antiretroviral-experienced Chinese adults with HIV-1 was assessed in a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study). Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive albuvirtide (once weekly) plus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (albuvirtide) or WHO-recommended second-line treatment (lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine; control). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma viral load <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Non-inferiority was pre-specified with a margin of 12%. Interim analysis of 48 week data from 46 subjects in the albuvirtide group and 50 patients in the control group showed 80.4% patients in the albuvirtide group had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL versus 66.0% in the control group (difference 14.4%, 95% CI -3.0% -31.9%), meeting the non-inferiority criteria.Efficacy and safety of long-acting HIV fusion inhibitor albuvirtide in antiretroviral-experienced adults with HIV-1: interim 48-week results from the randomized, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority TALENT study.

15,Lopinavir (LPV),Alcohol,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Alcohol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. The chronic use of alcohol may induce CYP2E1 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4. No a priori clinically relevant drug-drug interaction is anticipated with Kaletra TABLETS or CAPSULES. However, coadministration with Kaletra SYRUP is not recommended as the large amount of propylene glycol in the syrup may compete with alcohol for the same elimination pathway.",(See Summary)

17,Lopinavir (LPV),Alendronic Acid,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"If taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product.",(See Summary)
18,Lopinavir (LPV),Alfentanil,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Alfentanil undergoes extensive CYP3A4 metabolism.

Kaletra should not be co-administered with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life threatening events. These medicinal products include alfuzosin. Due to CYP3A inhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations of alfuzosin are expected to increase. Concomitant administration of Kaletra and alfuzosin is contra-indicated as alfuzosin-related toxicity, including hypotension, may be increased.Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012. Coadministration is contraindicated as potentially increased alfuzosin concentrations can result in hypotension.Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012."
20,Lopinavir (LPV),Aliskiren,Do Not Coadminister,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Aliskiren is minimally metabolized by CYP450, however, P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren bioavailability. A 5-6 fold increase in exposure was observed with itraconazole 100 mg twice daily (a CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) and a similar interaction is possible with lopinavir/ritonavir (due to inhibition of P-gp by ritonavir). The product labels for aliskiren recommend avoiding concomitant use with CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors.",(See Summary)
21,Lopinavir (LPV),Allopurinol,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as allopurinol is converted to oxipurinol by xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase. ,(See Summary)
22,Lopinavir (LPV),Almotriptan,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Almotriptan is partly eliminated unchanged in the urine and partly metabolized (mainly via monoamine oxidase-A and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and flavin monooxygenase).

23,Lopinavir (LPV),Aloe vera,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aloe vera is only a weak inhibitor of CYPs in vitro and therefore is unlikely to cause clinically significant interactions. It does not inhibit P-gp and there is no evidence to suggest it impacts UGTs.",(See Summary)
24,Lopinavir (LPV),Alosetron,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro data indicate that alosetron is metabolized by CYPs 2C9 (30%), 3A4 (18%) and 1A2 (10%); however, in vivo data suggest that CYP1A2 plays a more prominent role. In vitro data indicate that ritonavir induces CYP1A2, therefore coadministration with lopinavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease alosetron exposure.",(See Summary)
25,Lopinavir (LPV),Alprazolam,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Alprazolam is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4.

Monitor plasma concentrations and increase aminophylline dosage if needed.,(See Summary)
31,Lopinavir (LPV),Amiodarone,Do Not Coadminister,Moderate,"Coadministration has not been studied. Amiodarone is metabolised by CYP3A4 and concentrations may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by lopinavir/ritonavir. Coadministration is contraindicated in European SPC but the US Prescribing Information suggests caution and concentration monitoring (if available).

34,Lopinavir (LPV),Amlodipine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Amlodipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Lopinavir/ritonavir is predicted to increase amlodipine exposure by ~2-fold based on drug-drug interactions studies with amlodipine and indinavir/ritonavir or paritaprevir/ritonavir. If coadministration is indicated, consider a dose reduction for amlodipine of 50%. Use with caution as both lopinavir/ritonavir and calcium channel blockers prolong the PR interval. Close monitoring is recommended.","The impact on the PR interval of coadministration of Kaletra with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (including calcium channel blockers) has not been evaluated. As a result, coadministration of Kaletra with these drugs should be undertaken with caution, particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Clinical monitoring is recommended.

Increased concentrations of apixaban increase the bleeding risk and the combination should be avoided if possible.,(See Summary)
45,Lopinavir (LPV),Apomorphine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Apomorphine is metabolized by several pathways that include mainly glucuronidation and sulfation and to a lesser extent N-demethylation. Although protease inhibitors have the potential to induce glucuronidation, the clinical relevance of such an interaction is unknown considering the numerous pathways contributing to apomorphine metabolism.

47,Lopinavir (LPV),Argatroban,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Argatroban undergoes metabolism in the liver via hydroxylation and aromatization. In vitro studies indicate that CYP3A4 plays a role in argatroban metabolism, however, human drug-drug interactions studies suggest that metabolism via CYP3A4 is not a major elimination pathway in vivo.

49,Lopinavir (LPV),Artemisinin,Potential Interaction,Moderate,Data from clinical studies and population modelling suggest that coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir and artesunate or artemether decreases exposure of dihydroartemisinin (the biologically active metabolite) by ~40-60%. Further studies are required to determine the clinical significance of this reduction and if dose modifications are required.,"Note: Artemisinin, and its derivatives such as artesunate and artemether, are rapidly metabolized via CYP3A4 to a biologically active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin (the metabolism of artesunate is so rapid that it may be considered a pro-drug for dihydroartemisinin). Although the parent drugs and dihydroartemisinin all have antimalarial activity, dihydroartemisinin has greater potency than the parent drugs.Coadministration of artemether/lumefantrine (80/480 mg, given at 0, 8, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h) with lopinavir/ritonavir was studied in HIV positive, malaria negative patients in a parallel study (n=18 control group; n=16 lopinavir/ritonavir group). After adjusting for mg/kg dose, median day-7 lumefantrine concentrations were almost 10-fold higher in the lopinavir than the antiretroviral-naive group (3170 vs 336 ng/mL), with AUC and Cmax increasing 4.82-fold (2478 vs 445 μg.h/mL) and 2.67-fold (28.2 versus 8.8 μg/mL), respectively. ECG monitoring showed there was no increase in PR or QTcF, even at maximal lumefantrine concentration. For artemether, there were no significant differences between treatment groups for any of the pharmacokinetic parameters at either of the time periods studied. Dihydroartemisinin (active metabolite) AUC and Cmax both increased by 73% after dose 1 (0-8h) and by 12% and 19%, respectively, after dose 6 (60-68 h). The authors conclude that despite the increase in lumefantrine concentrations, no safety concerns were revealed for coadministration of artemether/lumefantrine and lopinavir/ritonavir. The interaction between artemether-lumefantrine and lopinavir/ritonavir-based antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1 infected patients Kredo T, Mauff K, Workman L et al.

With lopinavir/ritonavir (n=30), AUC and Cmax of artemether both decreased by 25%, and AUC and Cmax of dihydroartemisinin decreased by 19% and 17%; lumefantrine AUC and Cmax increased by 114% and 54%. Antiretroviral choice for HIV impacts antimalarial exposure and treatment outcomes in Ugandan children. Parikh S, Kajubi R, Huang L, et al.Clin Infect Dis, 2016, 63(3): 414-422.Coadministration of artesunate + mefloquine (200 mg daily + 750 mg day 1, 500 mg day 2) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 16 HIV-positive Thai subjects. Artesunate Cmax and AUC increased by 59% and 52%, but dihydroartemisinin Cmax and AUC decreased by 37% and 49%. Mefloquine Cmax and AUC decreased by 13% and 25%. Lopinavir Cmax and AUC decreased by 23% and 38%; ritonavir Cmax and AUC decreased by 52% and 54%. The 90% CI of the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of AUC and Cmax were outside the acceptable bioequivalent range for each drug. The authors conclude that the reduction in systemic exposure of all investigated drugs raises concerns of an increased risk of treatment failure rate in co-infected patients and should be further investigated.Pharmacokinetic interactions between artesunate-mefloquine and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir in healthy Thai adults. Rattanapunya S, Cressey TR, Rueangweerayut R, et al. Malar J,2015, 14: 400.Data from two clinical studies, investigating the influence of the HIV drugs efavirenz, nevirapine and lopinavir/ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the antimalarial drugs lumefantrine, artemether and their respective metabolites, in HIV infected patients were pooled and analyzed using a non-linear mixed effects modelling approach. Efavirenz and nevirapine significantly decreased lumefantrine exposure by ~70% and ~25% respectively while lopinavir/ritonavir substantially increased lumefantrine exposure (increase of 439%). All antiretroviral drugs decreased the total exposure to dihydroartemisinin (decrease of 71.7%, 41.3% and 59.7% for efavirenz, nevirapine and ritonavir/lopinavir, respectively). Simulations suggest that a substantially increased artemether-lumefantrine dose is required to achieve equivalent exposures when co-administered with efavirenz (250% increase) and nevirapine (75% increase). When co-administered with lopinavir/ritonavir it is unclear if the increased lumefantrine exposure compensates adequately for the reduced dihydroartemisinin exposure and thus whether dose adjustment is required.Artemether-lumefantrine co-administration with antiretrovirals: population pharmacokinetics and dosing implications. Hoglund RM, Byakika-Kibwika P, Lamorde M, et al.

When compared to the control group (n=16), artemeter exposure was significantly decreased in the lopinavir/ritonavir group (n=13); median Cmax decreased from 112 ng/ml to 56 ng/ml and median AUC decreased from 271 ng.h/ml to 162 ng.h/ml. There was no significant effect on dihydroartemisinin Cmax (66 vs 73 ng/ml) or AUC (217 vs 180 ng.h/ml). Lumefantrine Cmax and AUC increased during coadministration (2532 vs 7097 ng/ml, 46925 vs 267386 ng.h/ml).Lopinavir/ritonavir significantly influences pharmacokinetic exposure of artemether/lumefantrine in HIV-infected Ugandan adults. Byakika-Kibwika P, Lamorde M, Okaba-Kayom V, et al.

The addition of lopinavir/ritonavir significantly increased lumefantrine AUC by 2.3-fold and there was trend towards increased Cmax (1.4-fold). Trends towards decreased AUC (39%) and Cmax (22%) were observed with artemether pharmacokinetics, whilst there was a significant decrease in the AUC and Cmax (45% and 36%, respectively) of the active metabolite dihydroartemisinin. Pharmacokinetics of lopinavir were not significantly altered and there was a non-significant increase in ritonavir exposure. The authors conclude that the results suggest the coadministration of artemether/lumefantrine and lopinavir/ritonavir can be carried out safely, though a formal safety analysis should be addressed in coinfected subjects.Lopinavir/ritonavir affects pharmacokinetic exposure of artemether/lumefantrine in HIV-uninfected healthy volunteers..

Enhanced levodopa effects including severe diskinesias were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

128,Lopinavir (LPV),Ciclesonide,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Ciclesonide can be administered with lopinavir without dose adjustment, but with close monitoring. There is a risk of steroid side effects occurring, particularly if a high dose is used, or in case of prolonged administration, or if used with another medicine containing corticosteroids. These side effects are also more likely during periods of physiological stress. Ciclesonide is a pro-drug activated by esterases in the lungs to des-ciclesonide which then undergoes CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 7 days) with orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 µg once daily) did not alter ciclesonide but resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the AUC and a 2-fold increase in the Cmax of des-ciclesonide. Ciclesonide is mainly absorbed by the lungs, has a high protein binding and a high clearance resulting in a lower potential to cause systemic effects compared to some other inhaled corticosteroids. Hence, any interaction with lopinavir would not require any dosage/therapy adjustments, particularly if ciclesonide is administered at lower or medium clinical doses, but close monitoring for Cushing’s syndrome signs is required when using a higher dose or with prolonged administration. ",(See Summary)

149,Lopinavir (LPV),Clopidogrel,Do Not Coadminister,Low,"Coadministration of clopidogrel and boosted regimens has been evaluated in clinical studies. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite both by 69% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). In HIV-negative subjects (n=12), coadministration of clopidogrel and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 51% and 48%. Importantly, the decrease in clopidogrel’s active metabolite lead to insufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation in 44% of the patients treated with clopidogrel and ritonavir or cobicistat. Consistently, the study in HIV-negative subjects showed that the average inhibition of platelet aggregation was decreased from 51% (clopidogrel alone) to 31% (clopidogrel + ritonavir). Of interest, the study with HIV-infected patients showed a comparable decrease in prasugrel’s active metabolite AUC (52% decrease), however this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. The differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect is in line with clinical observations. Early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Taken together these data suggest that given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites. Marsousi N, Daali Y, Fontana P, et al. Clin Pharmacokinet, 2018 [epub ahead of print].The impact of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel active metabolite (AM) and the pharmacodynamic effect was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Subjects ingested either placebo or clopidogrel (300 mg followed by 75 mg the two following days) alone and together with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Ritonavir significantly decreased the exposure of clopidogrel AM by 51% and average platelet inhibition significantly decreased from 51% without ritonavir to 31% with ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -27% to -12%). The maximal platelet inhibition by clopidogrel was also reduced from 60% to 40% during concurrent ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -29% to -11%). The authors conclude that patients receiving ritonavir are at risk for diminished clopidogrel response and consequently increased risk for atherothrombotic events if the two drugs are used concurrently.

There have been several case reports of severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity when coadministered with ritonavir, a potent CYP3A inhibitor. Ideally avoid coadministration with boosted protease inhibitors or consider using an alternative taxane. ","Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. Taxotere (docetaxel) Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-Aventis, December 2009.Three cases have been reported where administration of IV docetaxel to HIV+ patients on ritonavir-containing regimens resulted in severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity 3-7 days after the first infusion of docetaxel (70-100 mg/m2), despite patients having normal baseline liver function and blood cell counts. Each patient recovered following the withdrawal of docetaxel. Severe toxicity related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. Mir O, Dessard-Diana B, Louet AL, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2010, 69(1): 99-101.A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours.

On day 15 or 22, patients received 100 mg i.v. docetaxel. Docetaxel AUC in patients who received 10 mg oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was low, and the dose could safely be increased to 100 mg. The AUC in patients who received 100 mg oral docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was 2.4 ± 1.5 and 2.8 ± 1.4 mg/L.h, respectively, compared with 1.9 ± 0.4 mg/L.h after i.v. docetaxel. The apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was >100% (i.e. 131 ± 90% and 161 ± 91%, respectively), indicating marked inhibition by ritonavir of gut wall and/or hepatic metabolism. Coadministration of ritonavir significantly enhanced the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel and caution is essential when giving docetaxel with boosted PIs.

However, a study with echinacea and lopinavir/ritonavir in 16 HIV- subjects showed no clinically significant effect of echinacea on lopinavir or ritonavir pharmacokinetics. ","The effect of echinacea (500 mg three times daily for two weeks) on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 16 HIV- subjects. Neither lopinavir nor ritonavir pharmacokinetics were altered by coadministration of echinacea (lopinavir AUC decrease by 4% and there was no change in Cmax). Although echinacea has been shown to modulate P450 3A4 in vitro, these data suggest a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Echinacea purpurea does not alter the steady state pharmacokinetics of lopinavir or ritonavir in healthy human volunteers. Malati CY, Robertson SM, Hunt JD, et al. 49th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, San Francisco, September 2009, abstract A1-1307.The effect of echinacea on CYP activity was assessed by use of a number of CYP probe drugs (caffeine for CYP1A2; tolbutamide for CYP2C9; dextromethorphan for CYP2D6 and midazolam for both hepatic and intestinal CYP3A) in a study in 12 healthy volunteers. The data demonstrated that echinacea caused inhibition of CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity and induction of hepatic CYP3A activity. The authors indicate that for CYP3A substrates (such as protease inhibitors), the type of drug interaction observed with echinacea will be dependent on the relative extraction of the drugs at hepatic and intestinal sites and will not be readily predicted. Certainly echinacea could contribute to inter-patient variability in protease inhibitor levels. The effect of echinacea (Echinacea purpurea) root on cytochrome P450 activity in vivo.

Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (500/125 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) had no effect on lopinavir concentrations relative to 400/100 mg twice daily administered alone. The Kaletra tablets dosage should be increased to 500/125 mg twice daily when coadministered with efavirenz.KALETRA ORAL SOLUTION:When used in combination with efavirenz and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in multiple protease inhibitor-experienced patients, increasing the dose of Kaletra 33.3% from 400/100 mg twice daily to 533/133 mg twice daily yielded similar lopinavir plasma concentrations as compared to historical data of Kaletra 400/100 mg twice daily. Dosage increase of Kaletra from 400/100 mg twice daily to 533/133 mg twice daily should be considered when co-administered with efavirenz. Caution is warranted since this dosage adjustment might be insufficient in some patients. Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012.Kaletra tablets and oral solution should not be administered as a ONCE DAILY regimen in combination with efavirenz. A dose increase is recommended for all patients who use Kaletra tablets or oral solution in combination with efavirenz. The recommended dose of Kaletra tablets is 500/125 mg twice daily (such as two 200/50 tablets and one 100/25 tablet). The recommended dose of Kaletra oral solution is 533/133 mg twice daily taken with food. Increasing the dose of Kaletra tablets to 500/125 (given as two 200/50 tablets and one 100/25 tablet) twice daily coadministered with efavirenz resulted in similar lopinavir concentrations compared to Kaletra tablets 400/100 mg (given as two 200/50 mg tablets) twice daily without efavirenz. Increasing the dose of Kaletra tablets to 600/150 mg (given as three 200/50 mg tablets) twice daily coadministered with efavirenz resulted in significantly higher lopinavir plasma concentrations compared to Kaletra tablets 400/100 mg twice daily without efavirenz. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 9 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir capsules (400/100 mg once daily for 9 days) to 11 HIV- subjects resulted in decreases in lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 3%, 19% and 39% respectively, when compared to data from 7 subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir alone. Efavirenz Cmax decreased by 9% and AUC and Cmin both decreased by 16% (compared to data from 12 subjects receiving efavirenz alone). Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 9 days) and Kaletra tablets (500/125 mg twice daily for 10 days) was studied in 19 HIV- subjects. When compared to values obtained with Kaletra tablets alone (400/100 mg twice daily), coadministration at the higher dose increased lopinavir Cmax (12%) and AUC (6%), and decreased Cmin (10%). Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 9 days) and Kaletra tablets (600/150 mg twice daily for 10 days) was studied in 23 HIV- subjects. When compared to values obtained with Kaletra tablets alone (400/100 mg twice daily), coadministration at the higher dose resulted in increased lopinavir Cmax (36%), AUC (36%) and Cmin (32%). The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir are unaffected by concurrent efavirenz. Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir capsules and efavirenz resulted in a substantial decrease in lopinavir exposure. With efavirenz, an increase of the lopinavir/ritonavir capsule or oral solution doses by 33% should be considered (4 capsules/~6.5 ml twice daily instead of 3 capsules/5 ml twice daily). Caution is warranted since this dosage adjustment might be insufficient in some patients. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (400/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) decreased lopinavir concentrations by 30-40%. When lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (500/125 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) were coadministered, lopinavir concentrations were similar to lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily without efavirenz.

Antivir Ther, 2007, 12(6): 963-969.A dose increase to 533/133 mg was advised when lopinavir/ritonavir capsules were coadministered with efavirenz. As this dose increase is not possible with the new tablet formulation (200/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per tablet), the coadministration of 2 tablets of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) with efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was studied in 21 HIV- subjects. Subjects received 3 lopinavir/ritonavir capsules (400/100 mg twice daily for 10 days) followed by 2 lopinavir/ritonavir tablets with efavirenz for 10 days. Lopinavir PK parameters were determined on days 10 (3 capsules alone) and 20 (2 tablets + EFV). Mean (± sd) lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Ctrough values on day 10 were 11.8±3.3 µg/ml, 95.7±33.7 µg.h/ml and 6.8±3.3 µg/ml, respectively. Cmax, AUC and Ctrough values obtained on day 20 were 10.5±4.0 µg/ml, 84.9±17.8 µg.h/ml and 5.0±2.7 µg/ml, respectively. Coadministration of efavirenz with the lopinavir/ritonavir tablet decreased lopinavir AUC and Ctrough by ~20% and 27%, respectively, compared to the capsule formulation administered alone. The concentrations obtained with the tablet + EFV were within the range of concentrations previously demonstrated to be efficacious in clinical trials. Pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and ritonavir after multiple dose administration of lopinavir/ritonavir tablet coadministered with efavirenz. Klein CE, et al. 8th International Congress on Drug Therapy in HIV Infection, Glasgow, November 2006, abstract P286.As the new lopinavir/ritonavir tablet is a fixed dose combination of 200/50 mg (the capsule dose is 133/33 mg), a dose increase to 533/133 mg when lopinavir/ritonavir is coadministered with efavirenz will not be possible. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir (600/150 mg twice daily) with efavirenz (600 mg once daily). When compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) given alone, lopinavir Cmax and AUC were moderately increased (36%); ritonavir Cmax increased 92% and ritonavir AUC increased 78%. The regimens were generally well tolerated. Pharmacokinetic effect of efavirenz on a new tablet formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir. Klein C, et al. 10th European AIDS Conference, Dublin, November 2005, abstract 4.3/2.Coadministration of an NNRTI (n=25; NVP n=9, EFV n=16) with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) resulted in a 39% decrease in lopinavir Ctrough but no change in Cmax, compared in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily alone n=125). There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking efavirenz and nevirapine. There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=125) and those taking lopinavir/ritonavir (533/133 mg twice daily, n=32) with an NNRTI (NVP n=3, EFV n=29). There was no statistically significant difference in ritonavir Ctrough or Cmax in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily with or without an NNRTI but patients taking lopinavir ritonavir 533/133 mg twice daily with an NNRTI had higher ritonavir Ctrough and Cmax. The number of patients with lopinavir concentrations below the 3000 ng/ml threshold was higher in those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 with an NNRTI compared to those without an NNRTI. However, the number of patients with suboptimal levels was comparable between those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg alone to those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg plus an NNRTI. Similar results were observed when a lower threshold (1500 ng/ml) was used. Therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir/ritonavir given alone or with an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Solas C, Poizot-Martin I, Drogoul M, et al., Br J Pharmacol, 2003, 57: 436-440.The coadministration of efavirenz with 2 NRTIs (n=19) or with 2 NRTIs plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100-532/132 mg twice daily, n=40) was studied in treatment experienced patients. No statistically significant modification in efavirenz plasma concentrations between the two groups was observed.

Poirier JM, Meynard JL, Zouai O, et al. 5th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Rome, April 2004, abstract 25.The steady-state pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 and 533/133 mg twice daily) when dosed in combination with efavirenz, plus two NRTIs, were assessed in 57 multiple PI-experienced but NNRTI-naive HIV+ subjects. When codosed with efavirenz, the 400/100 mg regimen resulted in lower lopinavir concentrations, (trough concentration = 3.66±2.64 µg/ml) than were observed in previous studies of lopinavir/ritonavir administered without efavirenz. Increasing the lopinavir/ritonavir dose to 533/133 mg increased lopinavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin by 46, 33, and 141%, respectively. Ritonavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin values were increased by 48, 46 and 63%, respectively. The lopinavir trough concentration (5.88±5.53 µg/ml) achieved with the 533/133 mg dose was similar to historical data obtained with lopinavir/r 400/100 mg in the absence of efavirenz (5.49±4.02 µg/ml).

In healthy volunteers, efavirenz had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir, with efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin being reduced by 16% or less in the presence of Kaletra. In healthy volunteers, efavirenz resulted in a 19% decrease in the AUC of lopinavir and a 39% decrease in the Cmin of lopinavir; there was no change in the Cmax of lopinavir. In HIV+ individuals, the decrease in lopinavir was 25% for AUC and 44% for Cmin. No dosage adjustment of efavirenz is required when administered with Kaletra. However, Kaletra should be increased by 33% from 400/100 mg to 533/133 mg when coadministered with efavirenz.

Subjects received lopinavir/ritonavir/amprenavir without (n=12) or with efavirenz (n=7). Lopinavir concentrations were similar to historical controls receiving lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily, while amprenavir concentrations were lower than those measured following the administration of amprenavir/ritonavir or fosamprenavir/ritonavir in the absence of lopinavir, but similar to those observed in a previous pharmacokinetic study which investigated the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir/fosamprenavir 533/133/1400 mg twice daily. At the doses studied in this small pilot study, efavirenz did not seem to have any inducing effect on either lopinavir or amprenavir, since when comparing drug concentrations in the two groups of subjects, no significant different was observed. However, a wider inter-individual variability in both lopinavir and amprenavir concentrations was observed in the efavirenz group.

Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 twice daily for 2 weeks) and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) to 18 subjects resulted in decreases in amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 58%, 63% and 65%, respectively. Lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 30%, 37% and 52% respectively. Amprenavir pharmacokinetics in 18 subjects were compared after administration of fosamprenavir/lopinavir/ritonavir (1400/533/133 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) versus fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks). In the presence of lopinavir, amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 13%, 26% and 42%. Lopinavir pharmacokinetics in this study were compared to those obtained following lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) and were similar (less than 10% change in Cmax, AUC, and Cmin values). An increased rate of adverse events has been observed. Appropriate doses of the combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.Co-administration of standard doses of lopinavir/ritonavir with fosamprenavir significantly reduced amprenavir concentrations. Co-administration of increased doses of fosamprenavir 1400 mg twice daily with lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg twice daily to protease inhibitor experienced patients resulted in a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and elevations in triglycerides with the combination regimen without increases in virological efficacy, when compared with standard doses of fosamprenavir/ritonavir.

333,Lopinavir (LPV),Heroin,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Lopinavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide.

There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of lopinavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as lopinavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.","The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites.

Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction.

347,Lopinavir (LPV),Iloperidone,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Iloperidone is metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and coadministration may increase concentrations. Iloperidone has been associated with QT prolongation and increased risk of arrhythmia and sudden death. Caution must be used when prescribing Kaletra and medicinal products known to induce QT interval prolongation such as iloperidone. The US Prescribing Information for iloperidone suggests a dose reduction of ~50% when coadministered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 but recommends avoiding the use of iloperidone in combination with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval.,(See Summary)
348,Lopinavir (LPV),Iloprost,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

349,Lopinavir (LPV),Imatinib,Potential Interaction,Moderate,"Coadministration has not been studied. Imatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 1A2, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. In vitro data indicate that imatinib inhibits CYPs 3A4, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on imatinib exposure is difficult to predict as clinical studies with CYP3A4 inhibitors have yielded differing results. Ketoconazole increased imatinib exposure; however, ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) had no significant effect on imatinib exposure. Use with caution and monitor for imatinib related side effects. Imatinib may increase exposure of CYP3A4 substrates, such as lopinavir.","Substances that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 activity (e.g. protease inhibitors such as indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, nelfinavir, boceprevir; ketoconazole, itraconazole; erythromycin, clarithromycin) could decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (the mean Cmax and AUC of imatinib rose by 26% and 40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when it was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be taken when administering imatinib with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolised drugs.Glivec Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, October 2012.There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (mean Cmax and AUC increased by 26% and 40% respectively) in healthy subjects when imatinib was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution is recommended when administering imatinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir). Substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Particular caution is recommended when administering imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window.Gleevec Prescribing Information, Novartis, January 2013.Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg). The dose of imatinib was decreased by 50% during coadministration with ritonavir (for safety reasons) and pharmacokinetic parameters were normalised to an imatinib dose of 400 mg. Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib. The authors suggest that at steady state imatinib is insensitive to acute CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and relies on alternate elimination pathways.Influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib. van Erp NP, Gelderblom H, Karlsson MO et al.

A dose increase dependent on the magnitude of decrease in lamotrigine concentrations was performed following PK analysis with further PK analysis 10 days later. At day 20, lamotrigine AUC, Cmin and Cmax decreased by 50%, 56% and 46%, respectively, thus all subjects received a dose increase to 200 mg twice daily. Increasing the dose restored bioequivalence on day 31 (lamotrigine AUC and Cmin decreased by 9% and 21%, Cmax increased by 3%; n=15). Lopinavir concentrations were determined in 6 subjects on day 20 and were found to be comparable with historical controls of lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily. Lopinavir/ritonavir decreased the AUC of lamotrigine, probably by induction of glucuronidation, and a dose increase of lamotrigine (to 200 mg twice daily) was needed to overcome the interaction.

Enhanced levodopa effects including severe diskinesias were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Administration of mebendazole with cimetidine, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in increased serum levels of mebendazole. The effect of administering a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor on mebendazole pharmacokinetics is not known. ","In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 1000mg mebendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. A trend towards an increase in mebendazole exposure after short-term intake of ritonavir was seen. However long-term administration resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC0-24 (57%) and Cmax (59%). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible.

Dose adjustment of nevirapine is not required when co-administered with lopinavir. Coadministration of nevirapine and lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution (300/75 mg/m2) to paediatric patients decreased lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 22%, 14% and 55%, respectively. For children, increase of the dose of lopinavir/ritonavir to 300/75 mg/m2 twice daily with food should be considered when used in combination with nevirapine, particularly for children in whom reduced susceptibility to lopinavir/ritonavir is suspected. Viramune Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, January 2012.Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with Kaletra(400/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily) in 22 patients was compared to lopinavir/ritonavir alone in 19 patients. Patients taking nevirapine had 27%, 19% and 51% lower lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively. The effect on nevirapine pharmacokinetics was not significant. A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets to 500/125 mg twice-daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution to 533/133 mg twice daily with food is recommended in combination with nevirapine.Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.The aim of this study was to assess the influence of nevirapine on lopinavir pharmacokinetics in order to optimise dosing regimens. The study included 15 HIV+ subjects, who received LPV/r (533/133 mg twice daily) and NVP (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks followed by NVP 200 mg twice daily). Steady state pharmacokinetic parameters were measured at week 4 and compared with data from patients (n=23) receiving LPV/r (400/100 mg twice daily) + 2 NRTIs. Following an increase in the LPV/r dosage, the mean ± sd LPV Ctrough was 5240 ± 4029 ng/ml, which was not significantly different from the mean Ctrough for LPV 400/100 mg bid + 2NRTI (4272 ± 3114 ng/ml, P=0.637). No statistically significant difference was observed in the mean AUC for LPV 400/100 mg bid + 2NRTI or with LPV/r 533/133 mg bid + NVP 200 mg bid (82746 ± 41019 vs 100940 ± 48871 ng.h/ml, P=0.3286). The findings suggest that an increase in LPV/r dose to 533/133 mg (4 capsules twice daily) is appropriate when co-administered with NVP. Data is awaited on the new tablet formulation of lopinavir in the presence of nevirapine.

There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking efavirenz and nevirapine. There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=125) and those taking lopinavir/ritonavir (533/133 mg twice daily, n=32) with an NNRTI (NVP n=3, EFV n=29). There was no statistically significant difference in ritonavir Ctrough or Cmax in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily with or without an NNRTI but patients taking lopinavir ritonavir 533/133 mg twice daily with an NNRTI had higher ritonavir Ctrough and Cmax. The number of patients with lopinavir concentrations below the 3000 ng/ml threshold was higher in those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 with an NNRTI compared to those without an NNRTI. However, the number of patients with suboptimal levels was comparable between those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg alone to those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg plus an NNRTI.

However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme.

556,Lopinavir (LPV),Prasugrel,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration of prasugrel with a pharmacoenhancer has been evaluated in a clinical study. Prasugrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6.

However this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. Conversely, this same study showed that ritonavir or cobicistat significantly reduced both clopidogrel’s active metabolite exposure and inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. These data are in line with clinical observations as early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of ritonavir or cobicistat boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects.

564,Lopinavir (LPV),Primidone,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Primidone is metabolised by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite phenobarbital. Phenobarbital induces CYP3A4 and is expected to decrease lopinavir/ritonavir exposure. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir may decrease phenobarbital exposure due to CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 induction by ritonavir. Use with caution and with close monitoring of patient's virologic response. Monitor lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations (when possible). ,"Concentrations of lopinavir may be decreased due to CYP3A induction by phenobarbital. Caution should be exercised in administering phenobarbital with lopinavir/ritonavir. Phenobarbital levels should be monitored when coadministering with lopinavir/ritonavir.

The decrease in proguanil exposure has been attributed to possible induction of CYP2C19 by lopinavir/ritonavir. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown due to the lack of data on the minimal effective atovaquone plasma concentration in the setting of malaria prophylaxis. Consider taking atovaquone/proguanil with a high fat meal to increase its bioavailability and increase the dosage if required.","The pharmacokinetics of atovaquone and proguanil were determined following administration of single doses of atovaquone/proguanil (250/100 mg) to HIV-negative subjects (n=18) and HIV-infected subjects stable on antiretroviral regimens containing lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily or 800/200 mg once daily, n=19).

585,Lopinavir (LPV),Quinine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Quinine is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 to an active metabolite, 3-hydroxyquinine. Quinine and it metabolites are also glucuronidated with up to 60% of the administered dose excreted as urinary glucuronides and ~20–25% excreted as unchanged quinine. Coadministration of single doses of quinine (600 mg, single dose) with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg, twice daily) in two studies decreased quinine AUC and Cmax by 56% and 47%, and by 50% and 48%; 3-hydroxyquinine AUC and Cmax by 99% and 85% in the first study and both decreased by 69% in the second study. No significant effects on lopinavir or ritonavir AUC and Cmax were seen in either study. Coadministration raises concerns of suboptimal exposure of the antimalarial treatment. However, since the free concentration of quinine was increased in both studies, further investigations are wanted to determine the clinical significance of this interaction and decide whether dosage adjustments are needed. In addition, caution is advised when prescribing Kaletra and medicinal products known to induce QT interval prolongation such as quinine (prolongation of the QT interval, widening of the QRS complex and T wave flattening has been noted with therapeutic doses of quinine).","Particular caution must be used when prescribing Kaletra and medicinal products known to induce QT interval prolongation.

Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04).

598,Lopinavir (LPV),Rifabutin,Potential Interaction,High,"Coadministration of lopinavir/r and rifabutin had no clinically significant effect on lopinavir exposure, whereas initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed a significant increase in rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) concentrations. Thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of lopinavir/r (400/100 mg twice daily) and rifabutin (150 mg 3 times a week) resulted in rifabutin concentrations that were lower than those observed with rifabutin 300 mg once daily without protease inhibitors suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg 3 times a week and lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia).","When rifabutin and Kaletra were co-administered for 10 days, rifabutin (parent drug and active 25-O-desacetyl metabolite) Cmax and AUC were increased by 3.5- and 5.7-fold, respectively. When given with Kaletra the recommended dose of rifabutin is 150 mg 3 times per week on set days (for example Monday-Wednesday-Friday). Increased monitoring for rifabutin-associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to rifabutin. Further dosage reduction of rifabutin to 150 mg twice weekly on set days is recommended for patients in whom the 150 mg dose 3 times per week is not tolerated. It should be kept in mind that the twice weekly dosage of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to rifabutin thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure. No dose adjustment is needed for Kaletra.Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012.Coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg once daily for 10 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg for 20 days) to 14 HIV- subjects resulted in increases in lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 8%, 17% and 20% respectively. Data in 12 subjects, and compared to rifabutin 300 mg once daily alone (for 10 days), showed increases in rifabutin Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 2.1-, 3.0- and 4.9-fold.

Further dosage reduction of rifabutin may be necessary. Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.Patients with TB-HIV co-infection (n=16) received rifabutin (300 mg once daily) in combination with tuberculosis chemotherapy (initially pyrazinamide, isoniazid and ethambutol then only isoniazid), and were then randomized to receive isoniazid and lopinavir/ritonavir based ART with rifabutin (150 mg three times weekly or 150 mg daily). The rifabutin dose with ART was switched after 1 month. Rifabutin AUC and Cmax in patients taking 150 mg rifabutin three times weekly was significantly reduced compared to the other treatment arms: AUC and Cmax decreased by 40% and 50% when compared to 300 mg once daily, and decreased by 60% and 50% when compared to 150 mg daily. 86% of patients on the three times weekly rifabutin arm had an AUC < 4.5 μg.h/mL, which has previously been associated with acquired rifamycin resistance. Plasma d-RBT concentrations increased 5-fold with three times weekly rifabutin dosing and 15-fold with daily doses of rifabutin. Rifabutin was well tolerated at all doses and there were no grade 4 laboratory toxicities.

BMC Pharmacol Toxicol, 2014, 15:61.A randomized, open-label, multi-dose, two-arm, cross-over trial, conducted in Vietnamese adults with HIV-associated tuberculosis evaluated rifabutin pharmacokinetics before and after the introduction of lopinavir/ritonavir. Rifabutin and 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin concentrations were measured after 2 weeks of rifabutin 300 mg daily alone, after 3 weeks of rifabutin 150 mg daily with lopinavir/ritonavir (n=12) and after 3 weeks of rifabutin 150 mg three times per week with lopinavir/ritonavir (n=13). Rifabutin 150 mg daily with lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with a 32% mean increase in rifabutin average steady state concentration compared with rifabutin 300 mg alone. In contrast, the rifabutin average steady state concentration decreased by 44% when rifabutin was given at 150 mg three times per week with lopinavir/ritonavir. With both dosing regimens, 2-5 fold increases of the 25-O-desacetyl- rifabutin metabolite were observed when rifabutin was given with lopinavir/ritonavir compared with rifabutin alone. The different doses of rifabutin had no significant effect on lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations.Randomised pharmacokinetic trial of rifabutin with lopinavir/ritonavir-antiretroviral therapy in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis in Vietnam. Lan NT, Thu NT, Barrail-Tran A, et al. PLoS One, 2014, 9(1): e84866.Plasma concentrations of rifabutin and 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin were determined in 16 HIV/TB coinfected patients who were receiving rifabutin 300 mg/day (n=9) rifabutin or 150 mg every other day (n=7) in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir. The mean Cmax and AUC of rifabutin in patients on rifabutin 150 mg every other day were 36% and 26% lower than in those on 300 mg/day, while the mean Cmax and AUC of 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin were 186% and 152% higher, respectively. Total concentrations of rifabutin+metabolite were similar between the groups within the first 24 hours, but remained low during the subsequent 24 to 48 hours under rifabutin 150 mg alternate day dosing.Pharmacokinetics of rifabutin in Japanese HIV-infected patients with or without antiretroviral therapy. Tanuma J, Sano K, Teruya K, et al. PLoS One, 2013, 8(8): e70611.The pharmacokinetics of rifabutin before and after the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir were examined in 10 patients with HIV infection and active tuberculosis. Samples were collected 2-4 weeks after starting rifabutin (300 mg thrice weekly) without lopinavir/ritonavir, 2 weeks after the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) to rifabutin(150 mg thrice weekly), and (if rifabutin plasma concentrations were below the normal range) 2 weeks after an increase in rifabutin to 300 mg thrice weekly with lopinavir/ritonavir. Concentrations of rifabutin, the microbiologically active 25-desacetyl-rifabutin, and lopinavir were determined. Low rifabutin Cmax values were observed in 5/10 patients on rifabutin 300 mg without lopinavir/ritonavir. After the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir to rifabutin 150 mg, 9/10 had low Cmax values. Eight patients had dose increases to 300 mg rifabutin with lopinavir/ritonavir. Most free rifabutin (unbound to plasma protein) Cmax values were below the tuberculosis minimal inhibitory concentration. For most patients, values for AUC were as low or lower than those associated with treatment failure or relapse and with acquired rifamycin resistance. One of the 10 patients experienced relapse with acquired rifamycin resistance. The recommended rifabutin doses for use with lopinavir/ritonavir may be inadequate in many patients. Monitoring of plasma concentrations is recommended. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of rifabutin in combination with lopinavir-ritonavir in patients with HIV infection and active tuberculosis. Boulanger C, Hollender E, Farrell K, et al. Clin Infect Dis, 2009, 49(9): 1305-1311.Coadministration of rifabutin alone (150 mg once daily) or rifabutin (150 mg three times weekly) plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 14 HIV- subjects. Point estimates for the sum of rifabutin and 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin Cmax and AUC48h were approximately 3-fold higher in the combination phase. Pharmacokinetic sampling that was originally planned for day 12 of the combination phase had to be performed on day 10 when study drugs were discontinued due to rifabutin-associated adverse events (13/14 subjects reported at least one adverse event).

599,Lopinavir (LPV),Rifampicin,Do Not Coadminister,High,"Coadministration of lopinavir with rifampicin is not recommended as it causes large decreases in lopinavir concentrations which may in turn significantly decrease the lopinavir therapeutic effect. Adequate exposure to lopinavir/ritonavir may be achieved when a higher dose of Kaletra (400/400 mg twice daily) is used but this is associated with a higher risk of liver and gastrointestinal toxicity. Therefore, this coadministration should be avoided unless judged strictly necessary. ","Coadministration of Kaletra with rifampicin is not recommended. Rifampicin administered with Kaletra causes large decreases in lopinavir concentrations due to CYP3A induction by rifampicin. The decrease in lopinavir concentrations may in turn significantly decrease the lopinavir therapeutic effect. A dose adjustment of Kaletra 400 mg/400 mg twice daily has allowed compensating for the CYP 3A4 inducer effect of rifampicin. However, such a dose adjustment might be associated with ALT/AST elevations and with increase in gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, this coadministration should be avoided unless judged strictly necessary. If this coadministration is judged unavoidable, increased dose of Kaletra at 400 mg/400 mg twice daily may be administered with rifampicin under close safety and therapeutic drug monitoring. The Kaletra dose should be titrated upward only after rifampicin has been initiated. Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012.Coadministration of rifampicin and Kaletra is contraindicated as it may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to Kaletra or to the class of protease inhibitors or to other coadministered antiretroviral agents. Coadministration of rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 10 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily for 20 days) to 22 HIV- subjects results in decreases in lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 55%, 75% and 99% respectively. Data from 10 subjects receiving rifampicin and lopinavir/ritonavir (800/200 mg twice daily for 7 days) showed a 2% increase in lopinavir Cmax, but decreases of 16% and 57% for AUC and Cmin, when compared to lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily alone. Coadministration of rifampicin with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/400 mg twice daily for 7 days) to 9 HIV- subjects resulted in decreases of 7% and 2% for lopinavir Cmax and AUC and an increase of 3% for Cmin, when compared to 400/100 mg alone. Pharmacokinetic and safety results from the 800/200 and 400/400 studies do not allow for a dose recommendation. Nine subjects (28%) experienced a grade 2 or greater increase in ALT/AST, of which seven (21%) prematurely discontinued study per protocol. Based on the study design, it is not possible to determine whether the frequency or magnitude of the ALT/AST elevations observed is higher than what would be seen with rifampin alone. Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.The steady-state pharmacokinetics of lopinavir were evaluated in HIV-infected adults stable on LPV/r tablets (400/100 mg twice daily) who were given rifampicin (600 mg daily), and the dose of the LPV/r gradually increased over a period of two weeks ( first to 600/150 twice daily and then to 800/200 mg twice daily). Twenty one subjects started the study, but two were withdrawn due to grade 3/4 transaminitis. The median [IQR) pre-dose LPV concentrations were 8.1 (6.2 to 9.8) mg/L at baseline, 1.7 (0.3 to 3.0) mg/L after 7 days of rifampicin, 5.9 (2.1 to 9.9) mg/L with 1.5 times the dose of LPV/r, and 10.8 (7.0 to 13.1) mg/L with double-dose LPV/r. There were no significant differences in the LPV AUC, Cmax, pre-dose concentrations, 12 h concentration, or half-life between the baseline and double-dose LPV/r time points. Doubling the dose of the tablet formulation of LPV/r overcame induction by rifampicin, with less hepatotoxicity occurring in this cohort of HIV-infected participants than reported in healthy-volunteer studies.  The cohort consisted of HIV-infected patients who were virologically suppress with high CD4 counts – the risk of hepatotoxicity may be different in HIV-infected individuals with TB and/or with different CD4 counts.Pharmacokinetics of lopinavir in HIV-infected adults receiving rifampin with adjusted doses of lopinavir-ritonavir tablets. Decloedt EH, McIlleron H, Smith P, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother,  2011, 55(7): 3195-3200.A study looking at the interaction between rifampicin (600 mg once daily) and LPV/RTV (600/150 or 800/200 mg twice daily) in 11 HIV- subjects had to be terminated early due to severe nausea, vomiting and elevated AST/ALT. No major complaints or laboratory abnormalities were noted during the first phase of the study (rifampicin alone), but 10/11 subjects suffered from nausea and/or vomiting following the addition of LPV/RTV. No LPV was detected in trough samples from 5/11 subjects (due to either no drug intake or vomiting); trough concentrations in 3 subjects receiving 600/150 mg were 6.7, 7.2 and 10.3 µg/ml and in 3 subjects receiving 800/200 mg were 8.3, 11.5 and 13.8 µg/ml. The reasons for the adverse events may be related to a) the sequence of drug administration, b) non-linear pharmacokinetics of LPV/RTV after intake of higher doses, or c) unknown factors which make healthy volunteers more susceptible to adverse events. Unexpected high incidence of nausea, vomiting and asymptomatic elevations of AST/ALT enzymes in healthy volunteers receiving rifampin and adjusted doses of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets. Nijland H, et al. 8th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Budapest, April 2007, abstract 51.Two twice-daily adjusted-dose regimens of lopinavir/ritonavir were tested in combination with rifampicin in healthy subjects. All subjects were treated with LPV/r 400/100 mg from days 1-15. From days 16-24 half the subjects were given LPV/r 800/200 mg (Arm 1) in dose titration and half LPV/r 400/400 mg (Arm 2) in dose titration. Rifampicin was given to all subjects between days 11-24. PK data was available from 19 subjects. The geometric mean ratio for lopinavir AUC12, Cmin and Cmax were 0.84, 0.43 and 1.02 respectively in arm 1 (800/200 mg) were 0.98, 1.03 and 0.93 respectively in arm 2 (400/400 mg). There was toxicity observed with the higher dose of LPV/r and rifampicin with discontinuation in 9/29 subjects (31%).

The US Prescribing Information states the recommended dose of saxagliptin to be 2.5 mg once daily when coadministered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors, (e.g., atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir).","Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 ketoconazole, increased the Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 62% and 2.5‑fold, respectively, and the corresponding values for the active metabolite were decreased by 95% and 88%, respectively. Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin, reduced Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 53% and 76%, respectively. The exposure of the active metabolite and the plasma DPP4 activity inhibition over a dose interval were not influenced by rifampicin. The co‑administration of saxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin have not been studied and may result in decreased plasma concentration of saxagliptin and increased concentration of its major metabolite. Glycaemic control should be carefully assessed when saxagliptin is used concomitantly with a potent CYP3A4 inducer.Onglyza Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol Myers Squibb – Astra Zeneca, December 2011.Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) and saxagliptin (20 mg or 100 mg single dose) increased saxagliptin AUC by ~2.5-3.7 fold and increased Cmax by ~1.6-2.4 fold.

Sildenafil was initiated at 25 mg once daily (for 7 days) and doses increased to obtain therapeutic concentrations, first to 25 mg twice daily (for 14 days) and then to 25 mg three times daily. AUC 0-8 h for the once daily, twice daily and three time daily regimens were 590, 518 and 800 ng/ml.h, respectively; corresponding Cmax values were 154, 159 and 183 ng/ml. Sildenafil mean half life in these subjects was 1.9 h compared to 2.6-3.1 h in the HIV+ subject. In order to achieve therapeutic concentrations, this patient had to be treated with a higher dose than the current recommendations of 25mg every 24 h or 48 h. The authors suggest that long term use of ritonavir may have resulted in delayed induction of PXR (and subsequently CYP3A4) in this patient.

The study had to be terminated early due to poor tolerance, which could possibly be related to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir leading to the formation of more toxic metabolites. Use with caution if coadministered due to poor tolerability. In addition, both lopinavir and sorafenib have been shown to prolong the QT/QTc interval.","Particular caution must be used when prescribing Kaletra and medicinal products known to induce QT interval prolongation. Indeed, Kaletra could increase concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products and this may result in an increase of their associated cardiac adverse events. Cardiac events have been reported with Kaletra in preclinical studies; therefore, the potential cardiac effects of Kaletra cannot be currently ruled out.Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Limited, February 2012.Coadministration of sorafenib with ritonavir was studied in patients with Kaposi sarcoma in a parallel study. One cohort consisted of patients receiving ritonavir (n=8), and the other of patients not receiving ritonavir (n=2). Those on ritonavir received 200 mg of sorafenib once daily, and those not on ritonavir, 200 mg sorafenib twice daily. Sorafenib AUC was unaffected by ritonavir coadministration, but a decreasing trend in sorafenib-N-oxide (CYP3A4 metabolite) AUC was noted. Sorafenib was poorly tolerated, and the study terminated early. The authors suggest that ritonavir may contribute to sorafenib toxicity by inhibition of CYP3A4, shunting of metabolism towards other pathways yielding more toxic metabolites that could possibly explain the toxicity observed.

Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.The interaction between tacrolimus and antiretroviral therapy (ART) was studied in 7 HIV/HCV coinfected patients who had received liver transplants. Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics were determined at steady state during the post operative period before and after the reintroduction of ART once tacrolimus concentrations and liver function had stabilised. Lopinavir/ritonavir markedly inhibited tacrolimus concentrations. Following the reintroduction of lopinavir/ritonavir, the tacrolimus dose fell by 99% to 0.02-0.25 mg/day (administered as 0.5-1.5 mg once every 7-25 days). Tacrolimus oral clearance decreased from 492 to 5 ml/min. Concentrations of lopinavir were within the ranges published for patients with normal liver function tests.

Teicher E, Vincent I, Bonhomme-Faivre L, et al. Clin Pharmacokinet, 2007, 46(11): 941-952.Tacrolimus concentrations were monitored following kidney transplantation in two HIV+ patients receiving LPV/RTV + EFV (Patient X) or LPV/RTV (Patient Y). Tacrolimus target concentrations were defined as 15 20 ng/ml immediately post transplant and then 8-12 ng/ml. Tacrolimus was initiated at doses of 0.5 mg for Patient X and 1 mg for Patient Y. Target concentrations were reached within 2 days for Patient X and 12 h for Patient Y. Patient X had to stop tacrolimus due to high concentrations (62 ng/ml). Tacrolimus half lives were calculated as 5.5 days for Patient X and 8 days for patient Y. After reintroduction of reduced doses of tacrolimus, target concentrations were maintained with doses of 0.5 mg given every 2 days for Patient X and given every 8 days for Patient Y. When given with boosted PIs, the initial dose of tacrolimus is critical, but unpredictable with reduced doses and daily TDM required.

Barrail-Tran, A et al. 8th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Budapest, April 2007, abstract 58.Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics were reported in 8 HIV+ patients who received liver transplants for end-stage chronic hepatitis C. Tacrolimus concentrations were determined ~10 days post transplantation (just prior to reintroduction of HAART) and 10 days after the reintroduction of standards doses of HAART (NFV n=2; LPV/RTV n=3; EFV n=2; NRTI n=1). During the post transplantation period, prior to the reintroduction of HAART, tacrolimus oral clearance (CL/F) ranged from 5.3 to 19.4 L/h. A large decrease in tacrolimus CL/F was observed following the reintroduction of LPV/RTV (0.5-0.9 L/h) or with NFV (1.1 and 3.0 L/h). Reintroduction of NRTIs or EFV resulted in little change in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. Coadministration of tacrolimus with LPV/RTV required dose reduction of tacrolimus to once every 5-10 days to maintain tacrolimus within the target range. Potent drug interactions between tacrolimus and lopinavir/ritonavir therapy in HIV-infected liver transplant recipients. Taburet AM et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 26.The management of drug-drug interactions between antiretroviral agents and tacrolimus in 10 HIV patients was reported. Antiretroviral agents were stopped on the day of liver transplantation and reintroduced 10 days later. All patients received tacrolimus and prednisolone as immunosuppressive agents and fluconazole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ganciclovir as primary prophylaxis. Tacrolimus pharmacokinetic parameters were measured 10 days following liver transplantation and 10 days following antiretroviral re-initiation. Tacrolimus target blood concentrations were 8-20 ng/ml from baseline to week 6 and 5-15 ng/ml after week 6; tacrolimus doses were individually adjusted according to the Ctrough measured. Among the patients studied, two were on nelfinavir, three on lopinavir/ritonavir, two on efavirenz and one on three NRTIs. While the NRTIs and efavirenz led to a slight change in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics, nelfinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir caused a large inhibition of tacrolimus metabolism, resulting in an increase in its half-life and a decrease in its clearance. Therefore, tacrolimus plasma concentrations should be monitored and drug dose adjustments performed. No alteration in the antiretroviral pharmacokinetic parameters was observed. Teicher E, Taburet AM, Vincent I, et al. 12th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Boston, February 2005, abstract 662.Data were reported from three transplant patients where tacrolimus concentrations were profoundly increased following initiation of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily). Patient 1 was stable on tacrolimus 5 mg twice daily (Ctrough = 10.6 ng/ml). Lopinavir/ritonavir was started and tacrolimus reduced to 6 mg/day; 2 days later Ctrough had increased to 78.5 ng/ml and tacrolimus was stopped. It was restarted after 21 days and the dose adjusted over two weeks to 0.5 mg/week which gave a Ctrough of 12.0 ng/ml. Patient 2 was stable on tacrolimus 4 mg twice daily (Ctrough 8.2-20.9 ng/ml). Lopinavir/ritonavir was started with a single tacrolimus dose of 2 mg followed by a further 1 mg dose 2 days later. Tacrolimus concentrations were 49 ng/ml (24 h), 20.6 ng/ml (60 h) and 7.2 ng/ml (38 days). Lopinavir/ritonavir was discontinued due to suspected toxicity with recurrent hepatitis C and the patient switched to nelfinavir. Patient 3 was initially stable on tacrolimus 2 mg twice daily (Ctrough 9.5-11.9 ng/ml), but discontinued tacrolimus from weeks 6 to 11 post transplant. Lopinavir/ritonavir was commenced 1 week prior to restarting tacrolimus; tacrolimus doses were adjusted until the patient stablised on 1 mg/week (Ctrough 2.9-5.4 ng/ml).

660,Lopinavir (LPV),Tamoxifen,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYPs 3A4 and 2D6 may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen.

Kiser J, et al. 13th Conference on Opportunistic Infections and Retroviruses, Denver, February 2006, abstract 570. Significant increases in TDF plasma exposure have been reported when coadministered with Kaletra. This study looked at the interaction at the intracellular level by investigating the effect of LPV/RTV (400/100 once daily) on TDF-DP concentrations in HIV+ patients taking TDF (300 mg once daily). There was a trend to higher TDF-DP concentrations when used in combination with LPV/r. However, due to interpatient variability, this did not reach statistical significance. Mean ± SD TDF-DP concentrations were 181.4 ± 80.1 and 280.3 ± 181.8 fmol/106 cells, alone and in combination with LPV/RTV respectively.

This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04).
