Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. There have been reports that dactinomycin may induce viral resistance to stavudine via a modification of cellular factors. The clinical relevance of this is unknown.","Actinomycin D (ActD) is a transcription inhibitor and has been used in the treatment of certain forms of cancer. ActD has been reported to be a potential inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication due to its ability to inhibit reverse transcription. In contrast to what was expected, low concentrations of ActD (1 to 10 nM) upregulated HIV-1 replication 8- to 10-fold in MT-2 cells and had no effect on HIV-2 replication or on HIV-1 replication in MT-4, Jurkat, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The upregulation of HIV-1 replication was associated with an increase in HIV-1 transcription and a decrease in CD4 and CXCR4 expression. To further evaluate the effects of ActD on emergence of drug resistance in HIV-1 replication, a series of drug resistance assays were performed. Of interest, treatment of MT-2 cells with ActD also led to a high level of resistance to thymidine analogs (>1,000-fold increase in resistance to zidovudine and >250-fold to stavudine) but not to other nucleoside reverse transcriptases (RT), nonnucleoside RT, or protease inhibitors. This resistance appeared to be due to a suppression of host cell thymidine kinase-1 (TK-1) expression. These results indicate that ActD leads to a novel form of thymidine analog resistance by suppressing host cell TK-1 expression. These results suggest that administration of combination drugs to HIV-1-infected patients may induce resistance to antiretroviral compounds via a modification of cellular factors.Actinomycin D induces high-level resistance to thymidine analogs in replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by interfering with host cell thymidine kinase expression.

Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (stavudine, didanosine, lamivudine, or zidovudine). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXomeThe pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

Based on limited data concerning metabolism, elimination and toxicity of melarsoprol, there is little potential for interaction, although due to the lack of data, vigilance is required if administering melarsoprol with antiretrovirals. It is unknown whether urinary metabolites of melarsoprol, such as arsenic, are excreted via active renal mechanisms, however a clinical study has reported that urinary pharmacokinetic parameters are not predictive of toxicity or therapeutic efficacy.

Therefore coadministration of stavudine with either doxorubicin or ribavirin should be undertaken with caution. Zerit Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, February 2019.In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. The clinical significance of the interaction with stavudine is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with ribavirin should be undertaken with caution. No pharmacokinetic (eg, plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (eg, loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with stavudine in HIV/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with or without ribavirin and stavudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of stavudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (eg, Child-Pugh >6). Zerit Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, December 2018.The effect of ribavirin (800 mg/day) on the plasma and intracellular PK of zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine was studied HIV/HCV co-infected subjects receiving zidovudine plus lamivudine, or stavudine plus lamivudine. Plasma zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine and intracellular drug and endogenous triphosphates were measured at baseline without ribavirin and after 8-12 weeks of ribavirin co-administration. Plasma results showed no impact of ribavirin on nucleoside concentrations and ribavirin levels were consistent with previous data measured in the absence of the three NRTIs. Similar findings were observed for the deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine triphosphate analogues, when given with or without ribavirin, suggesting that ribavirin does not perturb the intracellular metabolism of zidovudine, lamivudine or stavudine.Effect of ribavirin on intracellular and plasma pharmacokinetics of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in patients with HCV/HIV co-infection: final results of a randomized clinical study.
