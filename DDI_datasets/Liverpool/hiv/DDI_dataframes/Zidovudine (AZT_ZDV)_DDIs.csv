0,Zidovudine (AZT/ZDV),Abacavir (ABC),No Interaction Expected,Low,Clinical studies have shown no clinically significant interactions between abacavir and zidovudine.,"Clinical studies have shown that there are no clinically significant interactions between abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, December 2018.Fifteen HIV-infected patients were enrolled in a crossover-designed drug interaction trial evaluating single doses of abacavir (600 mg), lamivudine (150 mg), and zidovudine (300 mg) alone or in combination. Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine exposure (AUC decreased 15%) and zidovudine exposure (AUC increased 10%) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir. Ziagen Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, June 2019.Multiple dose pharmacokinetics were determined in HIV-infected subjects following coadministration of abacavir (200, 400 or 600 mg three times daily or 300 mg twice daily) alone or with zidovudine (200 mg three times daily or 300 mg twice daily). Coadministration of zidovudine had only small and inconsistent effects on the steady state pharmacokinetics of abacavir that did not increase with dose. At the clinical abacavir dose (300 mg twice daily), zidovudine coadministration had no effect on abacavir AUC. The pharmacokinetic profiles of zidovudine in the absence of abacavir were not determined; however, mean AUC and Cmax values for zidovudine in the presence of abacavir were comparable to historical steady state values. Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of abacavir alone and in combination with zidovudine in human immunodeficiency virus-infected adults. McDowell JA, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2000, 44:2061-2067. The pharmacokinetics and safety of single doses of abacavir (600 mg), zidovudine (300 mg) and lamivudine (150 mg) were evaluated when given alone or with either or both of the other drugs to 13 HIV-infected subjects. Coadministration of abacavir with zidovudine (with or without lamivudine) decreased ZDV Cmax by ~20%, delayed ZDV Tmax by 0.5h and increased AUC of zidovudine glucuronide by up to 40%. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir when given alone, or with zidovudine or lamivudine, or with both zidovudine and lamivudine.

However, pharmacokinetic data have shown that atovaquone appears to decrease the rate of metabolism of zidovudine to its glucuronide metabolite (steady state AUC of zidovudine was increased by 33% and peak plasma concentration of the glucuronide was decreased by 19%). At zidovudine dosages of 500 or 600 mg/day it would seem unlikely that a three week, concomitant course of atovaquone for the treatment of acute PCP would result in an increased incidence of adverse reactions attributable to higher plasma concentrations of zidovudine. Extra care should be taken in monitoring patients receiving prolonged atovaquone therapy.Retrovir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK, Ltd, December 2018.Coadministration of zidovudine (200 mg three times daily) and atovaquone (750 mg twice daily with food) to 14 subjects resulted in a 31% increase in zidovudine AUC and no change in atovaquone AUC. Routine dose modification of zidovudine is not warranted with coadministration. Retrovir Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, September 2018.The pharmacokinetic interaction between atovaquone (750 mg twice daily) and zidovudine (200 mg three times daily) was studied in 14 HIV-infected subjects. Atovaquone significantly increased ZDV AUC (from 1.82 ± 0.62 to 2.39 ± 0.68 µg.h/ml); in contrast the AUC of ZDV-glucuronide was decreased from 7.31 ± 1.51 to 6.89 ± 1.42 µg.h/ml. Zidovudine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone. The increase in ZDV AUC is unlikely to be of clinical concern; however, the interaction may be clinically significant in patients who are also receiving drugs that are toxic to the bone marrow (e.g. ganciclovir, amphotericin B, flucytosine). Atovaquone inhibits the glucuronidation and increases the plasma concentrations of zidovudine. Lee BL, et al. Clin Pharmacol Ther, 1996, 59: 14-21. "

Chloramphenicol and zidovudine are glucuronidated via the same route, predominantly by UGT2B7. In vitro studies have demonstrated that chloramphenicol can decrease the glucuronidation of zidovudine, and that zidovudine can decrease the glucuronidation of chloramphenicol. This could potentially lead to increased levels of either drug, although the clinical consequence is not known. As both chloramphenicol and zidovudine can cause myelosuppression, monitoring of haematological parameters is recommended.","The primary UGT enzymes responsible for chloramphenicol O-glucuronidation were evaluated in vitro. Reaction phenotyping for the glucuronidation of chloramphenicol with 12 expressed human liver UGT isoforms has identified UGT2B7 as having the highest activity for 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation with minor contributions from UGT1A6 and UGT1A9. The formation of 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronide by pooled HLM and expressed UGT2B7 exhibited substrate inhibition kinetics with apparent K(m) values of 408.2 and 115.0 microM, respectively. Azidothymidine (AZT) and hyodeoxycholic acid (substrates of UGT2B7) inhibited 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation in pooled HLMs. In 10 donor HLM preparations, both chloramphenicol 3-O- and chloramphenicol 1-O-glucuronidation showed a significant correlation with AZT glucuronidation (UGT2B7) at 30 µM chloramphenicol. These results suggest that UGT2B7 is the primary human hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoform catalyzing 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation with minor contributions from UGT1A6 and UGT1A9.Identification of human UGT2B7 as the major isoform involved in the O-glucuronidation of chloramphenicol. Chen M, LeDuc B, Kerr S, Howe D, Williams DA. Drug Metab Dispos. 2010 Mar;38(3):368-75. An in vitro study screened the effect of 55 molecules, representative of 20 different therapeutic classes, on 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) glucuronidation by human liver microsomes. At high concentrations, chloramphenicol caused more than 90% inhibition of AZT glucuronidation, in vitro. For compounds that appeared to inhibit AZT glucuronidation, extrapolation to the clinical situation must take into account both the in vitro apparent Ki values and the usual expected plasma level for the coadministered drug. By considering these parameters, this work indicates that clinically relevant inhibition of AZT glucuronidation may be observed with chloramphenicol.

ActD has been reported to be a potential inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication due to its ability to inhibit reverse transcription. In contrast to what was expected, low concentrations of ActD (1 to 10 nM) upregulated HIV-1 replication 8- to 10-fold in MT-2 cells and had no effect on HIV-2 replication or on HIV-1 replication in MT-4, Jurkat, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The upregulation of HIV-1 replication was associated with an increase in HIV-1 transcription and a decrease in CD4 and CXCR4 expression. To further evaluate the effects of ActD on emergence of drug resistance in HIV-1 replication, a series of drug resistance assays were performed. Of interest, treatment of MT-2 cells with ActD also led to a high level of resistance to thymidine analogs (>1,000-fold increase in resistance to zidovudine and >250-fold to stavudine) but not to other nucleoside reverse transcriptases (RT), nonnucleoside RT, or protease inhibitors. This resistance appeared to be due to a suppression of host cell thymidine kinase-1 (TK-1) expression. These results indicate that ActD leads to a novel form of thymidine analog resistance by suppressing host cell TK-1 expression. These results suggest that administration of combination drugs to HIV-1-infected patients may induce resistance to antiretroviral compounds via a modification of cellular factors.Actinomycin D induces high-level resistance to thymidine analogs in replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by interfering with host cell thymidine kinase expression.

This would be particularly important in patients with a known history of zidovudine induced anaemia. Retrovir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK, Ltd, December 2018.Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. However, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine 472 (n = 18), stavudine (n = 10), or zidovudine (n = 6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, exacerbation of anemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the HIV regimen. Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in established combination HIV-1/HCV therapy, especially in patients with a known history of zidovudine-induced anemia. Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and zidovudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of zidovudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Childs Pugh >6). Retrovir Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, September 2018.The effect of ribavirin (800 mg/day) on the plasma and intracellular PK of zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine was studied HIV/HCV co-infected subjects receiving zidovudine plus lamivudine, or stavudine plus lamivudine. Plasma zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine and intracellular drug and endogenous triphosphates were measured at baseline without ribavirin and after 8-12 weeks of ribavirin co-administration. Plasma results showed no impact of ribavirin on nucleoside concentrations and ribavirin levels were consistent with previous data measured in the absence of the three NRTIs. Similar findings were observed for the deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine triphosphate analogues, when given with or without ribavirin, suggesting that ribavirin does not perturb the intracellular metabolism of zidovudine, lamivudine or stavudine.
