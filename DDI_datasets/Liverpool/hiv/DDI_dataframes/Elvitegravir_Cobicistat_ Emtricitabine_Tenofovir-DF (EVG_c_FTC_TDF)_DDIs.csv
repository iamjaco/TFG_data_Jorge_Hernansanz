1,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Acamprosate,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acamprosate is eliminated unchanged in the urine both via glomerular filtration and active secretion (exact transporter unknown, possibly OATs or OCTs). Elvitegravir/cobicistat is unlikely to inhibit OCTs. Given the potential limited role of OCT or OAT in acamprosate’s elimination and considering the therapeutic index of acamprosate, no clinically relevant interaction with emtricitabine or tenofovir is anticipated.",(See Summary)

3,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Acenocoumarol,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. In vitro data indicate that elvitegravir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9 and could potentially decrease acenocoumarol concentrations. Monitor INR.

Acetazolamide is predominantly excreted unchanged via active renal tubular secretion. In vitro studies have shown acetazolamide may competitively inhibit renal transporters OAT1, OAT3 and OAT4 and therefore may increase tenofovir exposure. Close monitoring of renal function is recommended. Elvitegravir/cobicistat and emtricitabine do not interact with acetazolamide elimination.",(See Summary)
5,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Aciclovir (Acyclovir),Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Aciclovir	Coadministration has not been studied. Aciclovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1. Elvitegravir/cobicistat is unlikely to inhibit OATs at clinically relevant concentrations. However, because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of Stribild, are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with aciclovir may increase concentrations of emtricitabine and tenofovir. ","Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of Stribild are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs.

11,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),African Potato,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. African potato was shown to inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp in vitro and to activate PXR suggesting that inhibition may occur initially followed by induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp when used for extended periods.  This inducing effect is unlikely to cause a decrease in the exposure of elvitegravir and cobicistat, however, tenofovir-DF (the prodrug of tenofovir) is a substrate of P-gp and its absorption may be decreased due to induction of intestinal P-gp by African potato. No effect on emtricitabine is expected.",(See Summary)
12,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Agomelatine,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as agomelatin is metabolised predominantly via CYP1A2.

13,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Albendazole,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 and the flavine-containing monooxygenase system are involved in the formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. Elvitegravir/cobicistat could possibly reduce albendazole sulfoxidation and thus lower the clinical effect of albendazole. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Emtricitabine and tenofovir do not interact with this metabolic pathway.,(See Summary)
14,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Albuvirtide,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Stribild (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir-DF) is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV 1 infection and coadministration with other antiretroviral agents is not recommended in the Stribild product labels. However, in specific clinical situations where an intensification of HIV treatment is needed, coadministration with albuvirtide would be possible from a pharmacokinetic standpoint. Based on studies with lopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations of elvitegravir/cobicistat may decrease but this effect is not expected to be clinically relevant. An interaction with emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF is unlikely as albuvirtide is a peptide which is eliminated by catabolism to its constituent amino acids. Inhibition of metabolism by elvitegravir/cobicistat is unlikely to affect albuvirtide.","Stribild is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV 1 infection and must not be administered with other antiretroviral products.Stribild Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences International Ltd, May 2015.Stribild is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, Stribild should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection.Stribild Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, July 2015.Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 9 HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. Conversely, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone. The mean ratios (90% CI) of AUC, Cmax and Ctrough for lopinavir were 0.63 (0.49-0.82), 0.67 (053-0.86) and 0.65 (0.46-0.91). For ritonavir, AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 0.62 (0.42-0.91), 0.61 (0.38-0.99) and 0.72 (0.40-1.26).

16,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Alcuronium,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Alcuronium is predominantly eliminated unchanged via the kidneys. As there are no available data determining whether excretion is via active tubular secretion or glomerular filtration, there is some potential for competition with emtricitabine and tenofovir for active renal transport mechanisms, which may lead to increased levels of either drug.

17,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Alendronic Acid,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. If taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product.",(See Summary)
18,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Alfentanil,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Alfentanil undergoes extensive CYP3A4 metabolism. Elvitegravir/cobicistat could potentially increase alfentanil exposure.

Aliskiren is minimally metabolized by CYP450, however, P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren bioavailability. A 5-6 fold increase in exposure was observed with itraconazole 100 mg twice daily (a CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) and a similar interaction is possible with Stribild (due to inhibition of P-gp by cobicistat). The product labels for aliskiren recommend avoiding concomitant use with CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors. Significant interactions are not expected with emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF.",(See Summary)

Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid. About 20 to 40% of an oral dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours. After parenteral use about 60 to 80% is excreted in the urine within 6 hours. No interaction is expected with elvitegravir/cobicistat as it does not inhibit the renal transporters OATs and OCTs. However, as emtricitabine and tenofovir are eliminated by renal tubular secretion, there is potential for competition with ampicillin for renal transporters, which could lead to increased levels of either drug when ampicillin is administered intravenously.

42,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Antacids,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration with Stribild has not been studied. Elvitegravir plasma concentrations are lower with antacids due to local complexation in the gastrointestinal tract and not to changes in gastric pH. The European SPC recommends to separate Stribild and antacid administration by at least 4 hours, whereas the US Prescribing Information recommends at least 2 hours separation. Simultaneous administration of a magnesium/aluminium-containing antacid and elvitegravir/ritonavir decreased elvitegravir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 45%, 47% and 41%, respectively.

Ciclesonide can be administered with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF without dose adjustment, but with close monitoring. There is a risk of steroid side effects occurring, particularly if a high dose is used, or in case of prolonged administration, or if used with another medicine containing corticosteroids. These side effects are also more likely during periods of physiological stress. Ciclesonide is a pro-drug activated by esterases in the lungs to des-ciclesonide which then undergoes CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 7 days) with orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 µg once daily) did not alter ciclesonide but resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the AUC and a 2-fold increase in the Cmax of des-ciclesonide. Ciclesonide is mainly absorbed by the lungs, has a high protein binding and a high clearance resulting in a lower potential to cause systemic effects compared to some other inhaled corticosteroids. Hence, any interaction with elvitegravir/cobicistat would not require any dosage/therapy adjustments, particularly if ciclesonide is administered at lower or medium clinical doses, but close monitoring for Cushing’s syndrome signs is required when using a higher dose or with prolonged administration.

Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite both by 69% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). In HIV-negative subjects (n=12), coadministration of clopidogrel and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 51% and 48%. Importantly, the decrease in clopidogrel’s active metabolite lead to insufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation in 44% of the patients treated with clopidogrel and ritonavir or cobicistat. Consistently, the study in HIV-negative subjects showed that the average inhibition of platelet aggregation was decreased from 51% (clopidogrel alone) to 31% (clopidogrel + ritonavir). Of interest, the study with HIV-infected patients showed a comparable decrease in prasugrel’s active metabolite AUC (52% decrease), however this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. The differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect is in line with clinical observations. Early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Taken together these data suggest that given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites. Marsousi N, Daali Y, Fontana P, et al. Clin Pharmacokinet, 2018 [epub ahead of print].The impact of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel active metabolite (AM) and the pharmacodynamic effect was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Subjects ingested either placebo or clopidogrel (300 mg followed by 75 mg the two following days) alone and together with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Ritonavir significantly decreased the exposure of clopidogrel AM by 51% and average platelet inhibition significantly decreased from 51% without ritonavir to 31% with ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -27% to -12%). The maximal platelet inhibition by clopidogrel was also reduced from 60% to 40% during concurrent ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -29% to -11%). The authors conclude that patients receiving ritonavir are at risk for diminished clopidogrel response and consequently increased risk for atherothrombotic events if the two drugs are used concurrently.

His home medications included darunavir, ritonavir, emtricitabine-tenofovir, isoniazid, pyridoxine, clopidogrel, aspirin, carvedilol, rosuvastatin, valsartan, sertraline, tamsulosin and esomeprazole. Potential drug-drug interactions between isoniazid and clopidogrel, and ritonavir and clopidogrel were identified that could interfere with clopidogrel activation. Based on this, platelet function testing was completed and impaired clopidogrel response was seen on two platelet function tests. There was no genetic cause (i.e., CYP2C19 genotype) for the impaired clopidogrel response.A patient with HIV and tuberculosis with diminished clopidogrel response. Metzger NL, Momary KN.

187,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Diclofenac,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Diclofenac is partly glucuronidated by UGT2B7 and partly oxidized by CYP2C9. In vitro data indicate that elvitegravir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9 but a dose adjustment is unlikely to be required for diclofenac when co-administered with elvitegravir/cobicistat. However diclofenac could potentially decrease renal elimination of tenofovir (thereby increasing the risk of nephrotoxicity) as diclofenac is a strong inhibitor of MRP4. Coadministration could potentially result in increased risk of nephrotoxicity. The risk is increased if an NSAID is used for a long duration, if the patient has a pre-existing renal dysfunction, has a low body weight, or receives other drugs that may increase tenofovir exposure. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir-DF and with risk factors for renal dysfunction. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. If Stribild is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.","Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and with risk factors for renal dysfunction.

(e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)). Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of Stribild are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include high-dose or multiple NSAIDs. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF.

Coadministration increased norgestimate Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 108%, 126% and 167%, respectively. Cmax, AUC and Cmin of ethinylestradiol decreased by 6%, 25% and 44%. The effects of increases in the concentration of the progestational component norgestimate are not fully known and can include increased risk of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, acne, and venous thrombosis. The potential risks and benefits associated with coadministration of norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol with Stribild should be considered, particularly in women who have risk factors for these events. Coadministration of Stribild with other hormonal contraceptives (e.g., contraceptive patch, contraceptive vaginal ring, or injectable contraceptives) or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate has not been studied; therefore, alternative (non hormonal) methods of contraception can be considered.Stribild Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, July 2015. The pharmacokinetics of a combined oral contraceptive containing 25 µg ethinylestradiol and norgestimate was studied when administered alone or in presence of a fixed dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir (""quad"" tablet). Coadministration decreased the AUC of ethinylestradiol by 25% and increased the AUC of norelgestromin (the active metabolite of norgestimate) by 2 fold. Concentrations of elvitegravir/cobicistat were within the range of values observed in previous studies. Changes in progesterone and FSH were similar in both treatment phases, but changes in LH were greater in the combination phase. In light of the decrease in ethinylestradiol, it is recommended that when coadministered with the “quad” tablet, oral contraceptives should contain at least 30 µg ethinylestradiol.Pharmacokinetic interaction between norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol and EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF single tablet regimen.

During a routine check-up, he complained of reduced libido and erectile dysfunction. Tests revealed low cortisol, low ACTH and an inadequate response to tetracosactide. He was diagnosed with iatrogenic adrenal suppression. The fluticasone nasal drops were changed to beclomethasone nasal spray and hydrocortisone (10 mg, twice weekly) was initiated as physiological steroid replacement and weaned over two weeks. Both his cortisol levels and response to tetracosactide recovered. The authors hypothesise a drug-drug interaction occurred via inhibition of CYP3A4 by cobicistat, leading to increased fluticasone exposure and secondary adrenal insufficiency.A case of iatrogenic adrenal suppression after co-administration of cobicistat and fluticasone nasal drops.

Ibuprofen is metabolized mainly by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8 and direct glucuronidation. In vitro data indicate that elvitegravir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9, but a dose adjustment is unlikely to be required for ibuprofen when coadministered with elvitegravir/cobicistat. However, ibuprofen could potentially decrease renal elimination of tenofovir as in vitro data suggest that ibuprofen inhibits the renal transporters OAT1 (moderate inhibition) and MRP4 which are involved in tenofovir excretion. No a priori dose adjustment is recommended. Coadministration could potentially result in increased risk of nephrotoxicity. The risk is increased if an NSAID is used for a long duration, if the patient has a pre-existing renal dysfunction, has a low body weight, or receives other drugs that may increase tenofovir exposure. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir-DF and with risk factors for renal dysfunction. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.

However, mefenamic acid could potentially decrease the renal elimination of tenofovir as in vitro data suggest that mefenamic acid inhibits the renal transporter OAT1. Coadministration could potentially result in increased risk of nephrotoxicity. The risk is increased if an NSAID is used for a long duration, if the patient has a pre-existing renal dysfunction, has a low body weight, or receives other drugs that may increase tenofovir exposure. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir-DF and with risk factors for renal dysfunction. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. If Stribild is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.","Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and with risk factors for renal dysfunction.

(e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)). Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of Stribild are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include high-dose or multiple NSAIDs. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy.

In vitro data indicate that elvitegravir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9. A dose adjustment is unlikely to be required for piroxicam when coadministered with elvitegravir/cobicistat. However, coadministration could potentially result in increased risk of nephrotoxicity. The risk is increased if an NSAID is used for a long duration, if the patient has a pre-existing renal dysfunction, has a low body weight, or receives other drugs that may increase tenofovir exposure. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir-DF and with risk factors for renal dysfunction. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. If Stribild is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.","Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and with risk factors for renal dysfunction.

(e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)). Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of Stribild are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include high-dose or multiple NSAIDs. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF.

556,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Prasugrel,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration of prasugrel with a pharmacoenhancer has been evaluated in a clinical study. Prasugrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of prasugrel’s active metabolite by 52% and 43% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). However this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. Conversely, this same study showed that ritonavir or cobicistat significantly reduced both clopidogrel’s active metabolite exposure and inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. These data are in line with clinical observations as early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of ritonavir or cobicistat boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites.

Valaciclovir is converted to aciclovir which is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1. Elvitegravir/cobicistat is unlikely to inhibit OATs at clinically relevant concentrations. However, because emtricitabine and tenofovir derived from tenofovir-DF, components of Stribild, are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with valaciclovir may increase concentrations of emtricitabine and tenofovir. In addition, tenofovir-DF should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent.

713,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Valerian,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Coadministration of valerian with probe substrates for CYP3A4 (alprazolam) and CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan) modestly increased alprazolam Cmax and AUC (~20%) and had no effect on dextromethorphan. A clinically significant interaction is unlikely with drugs metabolised by CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 such as elvitegravir/cobicistat.

714,Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (EVG/c/FTC/TDF),Valproate,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Valproate is mainly glucuronidated by UGTs 1A6, 1A9 and 2B7 and metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Valproate has no inducing effects on metabolism. Valproate has been shown to significantly reduce total dolutegravir concentrations due to protein binding displacement. However, this interaction is not clinically relevant since the concentrations of free dolutegravir (pharmacologically active) are not decreased. Similarly, valproate is unlikely to cause a clinically significant interaction with elvitegravir/cobicistat. However, since elvitegravir/cobicistat is a modest inducer of CYP2C9, monitoring of valproate concentrations is recommended. Emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF do not interact with these metabolic pathways.","Concentrations of total and free dolutegravir were determined to elucidate the mechanism of the previously observed drug-drug interaction between valproate and dolutegravir. The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) were assessed in 3 HIV infected individuals in presence and absence of valproate (Depakine enteric; 30 mg/kg, divided in two daily oral doses administered during 14 days). Samples for total and free dolutegravir Ctrough plasma concentration were taken on day 0 (prior to coadministration of valproate) and on day 1, 7, 14 (all with valproate), and finally on day 42 (without valproate). Subjects in study arms on dolutegravir without valproate served as controls. Total dolutegravir trough levels (mean ± SD) prior and after valproate 2.1 ± 1.4 mg/L on day 0 and 1.6 ± 0.67 mg/L on day 42. Of interest, coadministration of valproate decreased sharply total dolutegravir Ctrough on days 1, 7, and 14: 0.89 ± 0.57, 0.40 ± 0.30 and 0.28 ± 0.21 mg/L, respectively. Conversely, the free fraction of dolutegravir increased from 0.29-0.30% without valproate administration to 0.54-0.7% during valproate coadministration. Importantly, all free dolutegravir concentrations were above the proposed in vitro EC90 value of unbound dolutegravir (0.9 µg/L). This study demonstrates that the reported decreased in total dolutegravir concentrations with concomitant use of valproate is due to protein displacement.
