0,Saquinavir (SQV),Abacavir (ABC),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.,"Abacavir has also been shown in vitro not to inhibit CYP 3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Induction of hepatic metabolism has not been observed in clinical studies. Therefore, there is little potential for interactions with antiretroviral PIs.Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, December 2018."
1,Saquinavir (SQV),Acamprosate,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acamprosate is eliminated unchanged in the urine.,(See Summary)
2,Saquinavir (SQV),Acarbose,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. After ingestion of acarbose, the majority of active unchanged drug remains in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to exert its pharmacological activity and is metabolised by intestinal enzymes and by the microbial flora.",(See Summary)
3,Saquinavir (SQV),Acenocoumarol,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ritonavir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9. Saquinavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease acenocoumarol concentrations. Monitor INR.,(See Summary)
4,Saquinavir (SQV),Acetazolamide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acetazolamide is primarily excreted unchanged via the kidneys, there is therefore little potential for interaction with saquinavir via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.",(See Summary)
5,Saquinavir (SQV),Aciclovir (Acyclovir),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as aciclovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1.,(See Summary)
6,Saquinavir (SQV),Acitretin,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as acitretin undergoes isomerisation and glucuronidation.",(See Summary)
7,Saquinavir (SQV),Aclidinium bromide,No Interaction Expected,Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aclidinium bromide is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed (non-enzymatic and enzymatic transformation by esterases and butylrylcholineesterases) to its pharmacologically inactive metabolites with only a minor role for CYP metabolism.,(See Summary)
8,Saquinavir (SQV),Adalimumab,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Adalimumab is a monoclonal IgG antibody. Elimination is similar to endogenous IgG and occurs primarily via proteolytic catabolism throughout the body.,(See Summary)
9,Saquinavir (SQV),Adefovir,No Interaction Expected,Moderate,"No data with saquinavir/ritonavir alone, but a clinically significant interaction is not expected. When saquinavir/ritonavir and delavirdine were coadministered with adefovir, saquinavir concentrations decreased by ~50% compared to values obtained with saquinavir/ritonavir and delavirdine alone. Further studies are required to confirm the exact nature and magnitude of the interaction between saquinavir/ritonavir and adefovir. ","LHPG Comment: Note, the results below were obtained with higher doses of ritonavir and in the presence of delavirdine. No significant clinically interaction is expected with boosting doses of ritonavir.ACTG 359 was a controlled study of SQV (soft gel) in combination with ritonavir (RTV) or nelfinavir (NFV) together with delavirdine (DLV), adefovir (ADV), or both. SQV was dosed at 400 mg q12h with 400 mg RTV or 800 mg q8h with 750 mg NFV. A pharmacology substudy obtained 12-hour AUCs in 42 subjects. In the RTV arms, SQV CL was 63.3% of the CL in the NFV arms, and F was 90% greater. The SQV half-life was 4.5 hours with RTV vs 2.8 hours with NFV. SQV CL was 49% faster in those arms containing ADV. No significant effect on SQV CL or F was noted for the presence/absence of DLV in the regimen. In conclusion, RTV produced a greater decrease in SQV CL than NFV. Interestingly, F was also greater in the RTV arms. These findings suggest differential inhibitory mechanisms of RTV vs. NFV on SQV CL and F. Overall, RTV caused a 3-fold increase in SQV exposure compared with NFV. ADV significantly decreased SQV half-life to 1.9 hours.Quantitation of Sex Differences and Drug Interactions: Pharmacologic Studies of Saquinavir (SQV) in ACTG 359. Brundage RC, Acosta E, Haubrich R, et al. 9th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Seattle, February 2002, abstract 799-W.A study was conducted with 38 participants split into six different groups A–F. Groups A and B received saquinavir and ritonavir plus delavirdine (A) or adefovir dipivoxil (B), group C received all four drugs. Groups D, E and F were as A, B and C but received nelfinavir instead of ritonavir. There was no difference on saquinavir concentrations when using nelfinavir or ritonavir, but saquinavir levels decreased by ~50% with delavirdine plus adefovir dipivoxil compared with delavirdine and saquinavir alone.Competing drug-drug interactions among multidrug antiretroviral regimens used in the treatment of HIV-infected subjects ACTG 884.

10,Saquinavir (SQV),Adrenaline (Epinephrine),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated, mostly in the liver by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). There is therefore little potential for interaction with saquinavir via modulation of, or competition for metabolic or elimination pathways.",(See Summary)
11,Saquinavir (SQV),African Potato,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolic data there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. African potato was shown to inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp in vitro and to activate PXR suggesting that inhibition may occur initially followed by induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp when used for extended periods. However, coadministration of African potato with lopinavir/ritonavir in healthy volunteers did not result in significant pharmacokinetic changes suggesting that boosting by ritonavir could offset the inducing effect of African potato. Similarly, no significant effect is expected on the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir.",(See Summary)
12,Saquinavir (SQV),Agomelatine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Agomelatine is metabolised predominantly by CYP1A2 which is induced by ritonavir. Coadministration with saquinavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease agomelatine exposure. Monitor clinical effect and increase dosage if needed. ,(See Summary)
13,Saquinavir (SQV),Albendazole,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 and the flavine-containing monooxygenase system are involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. Short term (2 doses) coadministration with ritonavir (200 mg) did not impact albendazole pharmacokinetics whereas long-term coadministration (8 days) decreased albendazole exposure likely due to ritonavir inducing effect. Saquinavir/ritonavir is unlikely to significantly affect albendazole exposure when used for a short duration treatment but may reduce the clinical effect of albendazole when used for a long duration treatment.,"In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400 mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and  its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

14,Saquinavir (SQV),Albuvirtide,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Albuvirtide is a peptide which is eliminated by catabolism to its constituent amino acids. Based on data from studies with lopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations of saquinavir/ritonavir may decrease but this is not expected to be clinically relevant. Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. However, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone (lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 37%, 33% and 35%, respectively; ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 38%, 39% and 28%, respectively). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 µg/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy. Furthermore, a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study) showed that albuvirtide + lopinavir/ritonavir was non-inferior to the standard second-line regimen lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine in HIV infected Chinese individuals suggesting that this interaction has no clinical consequences. In vitro human microsomal studies indicate that albuvirtide has no inducing properties on P450 enzymes. In addition, albuvirtide binds to <1% of serum albumin in the range of clinical concentrations, thus the observed decrease in lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations is unlikely to result from protein binding displacement. However, binding of the albuvirtide-albumin complex to the HIV protease inhibitor cannot be excluded.","Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 9 HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. Conversely, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone. The mean ratios (90% CI) of AUC, Cmax and Ctrough for lopinavir were 0.63 (0.49-0.82), 0.67 (053-0.86) and 0.65 (0.46-0.91). For ritonavir, AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 0.62 (0.42-0.91), 0.61 (0.38-0.99) and 0.72 (0.40-1.26). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 ug/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy.Evaluation of pharmacokinetic interactions between long-acting HIV-1 fusion inhibitor albuvirtide and lopinavir/ritonavir, in HIV-infected subjects, combined with clinical study and simulation results. Yang W, Xiao Q, Wang D, et al. Xenobiotica. 2017, 47(2): 133-143.The safety and efficacy of albuvirtide plus lopinavir-ritonavir in antiretroviral-experienced Chinese adults with HIV-1 was assessed in a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study). Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive albuvirtide (once weekly) plus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (albuvirtide) or WHO-recommended second-line treatment (lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine; control). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma viral load <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Non-inferiority was pre-specified with a margin of 12%. Interim analysis of 48 week data from 46 subjects in the albuvirtide group and 50 patients in the control group showed 80.4% patients in the albuvirtide group had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL versus 66.0% in the control group (difference 14.4%, 95% CI -3.0% -31.9%), meeting the non-inferiority criteria.Efficacy and safety of long-acting HIV fusion inhibitor albuvirtide in antiretroviral-experienced adults with HIV-1: interim 48-week results from the randomized, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority TALENT study.

Aliskiren is minimally metabolized by CYP450, however, P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren bioavailability. A 5-6 fold increase in exposure was observed with itraconazole 100 mg twice daily (a CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) and a similar interaction is possible with saquinavir/ritonavir (due to inhibition of P-gp by ritonavir). The product labels for aliskiren recommend avoiding concomitant use with CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors.",(See Summary)

Enhanced levodopa effects including severe diskinesias were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Ciclesonide can be administered with saquinavir without dose adjustment, but with close monitoring. There is a risk of steroid side effects occurring, particularly if a high dose is used, or in case of prolonged administration, or if used with another medicine containing corticosteroids. These side effects are also more likely during periods of physiological stress. Ciclesonide is a pro-drug activated by esterases in the lungs to des-ciclesonide which then undergoes CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 7 days) with orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 µg once daily) did not alter ciclesonide but resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the AUC and a 2-fold increase in the Cmax of des-ciclesonide. Ciclesonide is mainly absorbed by the lungs, has a high protein binding and a high clearance resulting in a lower potential to cause systemic effects compared to some other inhaled corticosteroids.

149,Saquinavir (SQV),Clopidogrel,Do Not Coadminister,Low,"Coadministration of clopidogrel and boosted regimens has been evaluated in clinical studies. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite both by 69% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). In HIV-negative subjects (n=12), coadministration of clopidogrel and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 51% and 48%. Importantly, the decrease in clopidogrel’s active metabolite lead to insufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation in 44% of the patients treated with clopidogrel and ritonavir or cobicistat. Consistently, the study in HIV-negative subjects showed that the average inhibition of platelet aggregation was decreased from 51% (clopidogrel alone) to 31% (clopidogrel + ritonavir). Of interest, the study with HIV-infected patients showed a comparable decrease in prasugrel’s active metabolite AUC (52% decrease), however this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. The differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect is in line with clinical observations. Early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Taken together these data suggest that given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites. Marsousi N, Daali Y, Fontana P, et al. Clin Pharmacokinet, 2018 [epub ahead of print].The impact of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel active metabolite (AM) and the pharmacodynamic effect was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Subjects ingested either placebo or clopidogrel (300 mg followed by 75 mg the two following days) alone and together with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Ritonavir significantly decreased the exposure of clopidogrel AM by 51% and average platelet inhibition significantly decreased from 51% without ritonavir to 31% with ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -27% to -12%). The maximal platelet inhibition by clopidogrel was also reduced from 60% to 40% during concurrent ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -29% to -11%).

Simultaneous administration did not significantly change dabigatran PK (possibly due to mixed induction and inhibition of P-gp by ritonavir as dabigatran is a substrate of P-gp). Administration 2 hours before ritonavir decreased dabigatran AUC by 29% and Cmax by 27% (n=16). These results suggests that dabigatran can be administered simultaneously with ritonavir when used once daily as a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with no renal impairment, though no data are available when ritonavir is used twice daily as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Data with verapamil (a P-gp inhibitor) and dabigatran suggest caution is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment as the dabigatran dose might need to be reduced in presence of a P-gp inhibitor such as saquinavir/ritonavir.

However, Ctrough was below the lower limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered at 110 mg twice daily 2 hours before verapamil but still within the therapeutic range in case of simultaneous administration. In individuals with mild renal impairment, predicted Ctrough exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered concurrently or 2 hours before verapamil at a dose of 150 mg twice daily but were within the therapeutic range when administered at a dose of 110 mg twice daily.

Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXomeThe pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

","Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. Taxotere (docetaxel) Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-Aventis, December 2009.Three cases have been reported where administration of IV docetaxel to HIV+ patients on ritonavir-containing regimens resulted in severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity 3-7 days after the first infusion of docetaxel (70-100 mg/m2), despite patients having normal baseline liver function and blood cell counts. Each patient recovered following the withdrawal of docetaxel. Severe toxicity related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. Mir O, Dessard-Diana B, Louet AL, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2010, 69(1): 99-101.A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours.

Subjects (n=56) received efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 10 days and restarted amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with efavirenz for days 11 to 13 with a PK study on day 14. A second PI (nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily; indinavir 1200 mg twice daily; ritonavir 100 mg twice daily; or saquinavir 1600 mg twice daily) was added to amprenavir and efavirenz on day 15, and a PK study was conducted on day 21. Controls continued amprenavir and efavirenz without a second PI. Amprenavir AUC was 46-61% lower with efavirenz (day 14 vs day 0; P values of <0.05). In the nelfinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir groups, day 21 amprenavir AUCs with efavirenz were higher than AUCs for efavirenz alone.

333,Saquinavir (SQV),Heroin,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Saquinavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide.

346,Saquinavir (SQV),Ifosfamide,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of saquinavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as saquinavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.","The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites.

In vitro data indicate that imatinib inhibits CYPs 3A4, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. The effect of saquinavir/ritonavir on imatinib exposure is difficult to predict as clinical studies with CYP3A4 inhibitors have yielded differing results. Ketoconazole increased imatinib exposure; however, ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) had no significant effect on imatinib exposure. Use with caution and monitor for imatinib related side effects. Imatinib may increase exposure of CYP3A4 substrates, such as saquinavir. ","Substances that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 activity (e.g. protease inhibitors such as indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, nelfinavir, boceprevir; ketoconazole, itraconazole; erythromycin, clarithromycin) could decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (the mean Cmax and AUC of imatinib rose by 26% and 40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when it was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be taken when administering imatinib with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolised drugs.Glivec Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, October 2012.There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (mean Cmax and AUC increased by 26% and 40% respectively) in healthy subjects when imatinib was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution is recommended when administering imatinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir).

Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib.

When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Cardiac events are unlikely to occur when loperamide is dosed as an antidiarrheal even if coadministered with saquinavir/ritonavir. However caution is advised when loperamide is used at high doses for reducing stoma output, particularly as patients may be at increased risk of cardiac events due to electrolytes disturbances.","Coadministration of saquinavir (600 mg single dose) and loperamide (16 mg single dose) was investigaed in a randomised, double-blind, double-placebo, three-way crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers (6 male, 6 female). Concomitant saquinavir administration reduced apparent oral clearance of loperamide, resulting in a 40% increase in loperamide AUC (116 vs 164 pmol.h/ml). Coadministration of loperamide reduced saquinavir AUC and Cmax by 54%(1189 vs 550 pmol.h/ml) and 46% (404 vs 217 pmol.h/ml) respectively.

557,Saquinavir (SQV),Prasugrel,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration of prasugrel with a pharmacoenhancer has been evaluated in a clinical study. Prasugrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of prasugrel’s active metabolite by 52% and 43% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). However this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. Conversely, this same study showed that ritonavir or cobicistat significantly reduced both clopidogrel’s active metabolite exposure and inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. These data are in line with clinical observations as early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of ritonavir or cobicistat boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites.

582,Saquinavir (SQV),Quercetin,Potential Interaction,Moderate,Coadministration with saquinavir/ritonavir has not been studied.  Coadministration with saquinavir had no effect on plasma or intracellular saquinavir concentrations.

Quercetin inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp in vitro but animal studies have yielded inconsistent results. Use with caution and monitor patients carefully regarding their HIV infection.,"Coadministration of saquinavir (1200 mg three times daily) and quercetin (500 mg three times daily) was investigated in 10 healthy subjects. It was found that quercetin did not affect plasma or intracellular concentrations of saquinavir (plasma AUC 2.08 vs 1.60 µg/ml.h, Cmax 0.51 vs 0.68 µg/ml, Cmin 0.046 vs 0.041 µg/ml; alone vs with quercetin). There was a statistically insignificant trend towards lower quercetin plasma concentrations with given with saquinavir (AUC 0.067 vs 0.030 µg/ml.h, Cmax 0.015 vs 0.010 µg/ml; alone vs with saquinavir).

Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04).

RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

599,Saquinavir (SQV),Rifabutin,Potential Interaction,Low,"Do not coadminister with unboosted saquinavir. Coadministration with saquinavir/ritonavir had no significant effect on saquinavir or ritonavir, but increased exposure to rifabutin and its active metabolite. Initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed that concentrations of rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) were significantly increased when combined with a boosted protease inhibitor, thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r and rifabutin (150 mg three times a week) resulted in rifabutin concentrations that were lower than those observed with rifabutin 300 mg once daily without protease inhibitors suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg  3 times a week and lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia).","Coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg every 3 days) and saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) decreased saquinavir AUC and Cmax by 13% and 15%, respectively; there was no change in ritonavir AUC and Cmax. Rifabutin AUC and Cmax increased by 53% and 86%, respectively; total rifabutin activity increased by 134% (AUC) and 130% (Cmax). To prevent possible development of rifabutin resistance in TB and HIV co-infected patients, the recommended dose of rifabutin is 150 mg every other day or three times per week, with the dose of saquinavir/ritonavir unchanged (1000/100 mg twice daily). Monitoring of neutropenia and liver enzyme levels is recommended due to an expected increase in exposure to rifabutin. Invirase Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, June 2012. Coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg every 4 days) with saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) to 11 subjects increased the AUC and Cmax of  the total rifabutin active moiety by 60% and 111%, respectively (compared to rifabutin 150 mg once daily alone). When rifabutin (150 mg every 3 days) and saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) were coadministered to 19 subjects, saquinavir AUC and Cmax decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively. No dose adjustment of saquianvir/ritonavir (1000/100mg twice daily) is required if ritonavir-boosted saquinavir is administered in combination with rifabutin. Dosage reduction of rifabutin by at least 75% of the usual dose of 300 mg/day is recommended (i.e., a maximum dose of 150 mg every other day or three times per week).

The AUC and Cmax of the active moiety (rifabutin plus 25-O-desacetyl-rifabutin) increased by 134% and 130%, respectively, compared with administration of rifabutin 150 mg once daily alone.  When rifabutin was coadministered every 4 days, there was no change in rifabutin AUC and Cmax increased by 68%, compared to rifabutin 150 mg once daily alone. The AUC and Cmax of the active moiety increased by 60% and 111%, respectively.  No adjustment of the saquinavir/ritonavir dose is required when the drugs are administered in combination with rifabutin. Although the pharmacokinetic results of this study support the administration of rifabutin 150 mg every 4 days, it should be noted that the rifabutin exposure determined in healthy subjects may not be sufficient to control acquired rifamycin resistance in the patient population.  The authors acknowledge that more frequent dosing (e.g. 150 mg three times a week or every other day) may be needed to treat HIV patients with active TB in order to prevent acquired rifamycin resistance.  Monitoring of neutropenia and liver enzyme levels is recommended for patients receiving rifabutin with saquinavir/ritonavir.Pharmacokinetic interaction study of ritonavir-boosted saquinavir in combination with rifabutin in healthy subjects.

Fourteen healthy volunteers were recruited into each arm of a two period crossover study: Group 1 - SQV/RTV 1000/100 mg twice daily for 14 days followed by SQV/RTV + rifampicin 600 mg once daily for 14 days; Group 2 – rifampicin 600 mg once daily for 14 days followed by rifampicin + SQV/RTV 1000/100 mg twice daily for 14 days. Day 14 steady state concentrations of SQV, RTV, rifampicin and desacetyl-rifampicin were within expected ranges. Elevated grade 1 transaminases levels were reported by day 14 in 2/14 subjects receiving rifampicin alone. Dosing was continued beyond day 14 in 17/28 subjects, 11 of whom developed elevated transaminases levels resulting in the discontinuation of the study. Grades 2 and 3 adverse events were reported in 2 subjects in group 1, with 9 subjects in group 2 reporting grades 3 and 4 adverse events. Clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities were generally more common and severe in group 2 than group 1. The limited data available suggested a trend towards increased desacetyl-rifampicin concentrations and a possible causal relationship between concentrations and elevated transaminases. Clinical symptoms resolved and transaminase levels reduced following discontinuation of study drugs. Although limited data warrants cautious interpretation, they suggest that the hepatotoxicity was mediated by direct and/or indirect effects of rifampicin exposure.

Based on cross-study comparison to saquinavir alone (600 mg three daily), coadministration of saquinavir (1000 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased saquinavir AUC by 15-fold and Cmin by 5-fold; ritonavir AUC and Cmin were unchanged. Based on cross-study comparison to saquinavir alone (600 mg three daily), coadministration of saquinavir (400 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) increased saquinavir AUC by 17-fold with no change in ritonavir AUC or Cmin. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of saquinavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Saquinavir should only be given in combination with ritonavir. Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily provides saquinavir systemic exposure over 24 hours similar to or greater than those achieved with saquinavir 1200 mg three times daily without ritonavir. Saquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin, due to the risk of severe hepatotoxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases) if the three medicines are given together. In a clinical study investigating the interaction of rifampicin 600 mg once daily and saquinavir 1000 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in healthy volunteers, severe hepatocellular toxicity with transaminase elevations up to >20-fold the upper limit of normal after 1 to 5 days of co-administration was noted. Due to the risk of severe hepatoxicity, saquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin.

Coadministration with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) increased roflumilast exposure by 2 fold with no significant effect on roflumilast N-oxide exposure. These changes did not translate into significant changes in the inhibitory effect on PDE4 and did not affect the known safety and tolerability profile of roflumilast.

740,Saquinavir (SQV),Zonisamide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Zonisamide is metabolized partly by CYP3A4 and also by N-acetyl-transferases and conjugation. Coadministration could potentially increase zonisamide concentrations. This interaction may not be clinically relevant as coadministration of zonisamide and ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) had no effect on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of zonisamide given to healthy subjects.,(See Summary)
741,Saquinavir (SQV),Zopiclone,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Zopiclone is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8. Saquinavir/ritonavir could potentially increase zopiclone exposure which could result in increased sedation. A dosage reduction may be needed.,(See Summary)
742,Saquinavir (SQV),Zotepine,Do Not Coadminister,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Zotepine is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, and can prolong the QT interval. Saquinavir/ritonavir could potentially increase zotepine concentrations and thus increase the risk for QT interval prolongation. Saquinavir is contraindicated in patients on concomitant therapy with other drugs that prolong the QT interval.","Dose-dependent prolongations of QT and PR intervals have been observed in healthy volunteers receiving ritonavir-boosted saquinavir.

744,Saquinavir (SQV),Trastuzumab emtansine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but is not recommended. Trastuzumab emtansine is a monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate. Trastuzumab does not undergo CYP mediated metabolism, however, DM1 (an active component of emtansine) is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration is not recommended due to the potential for an increase in DM1 exposure and toxicity. Consider switching to an antiretroviral regimen with no inhibitory effects on CYP3A4. If coadministration is unavoidable, consider delaying trastuzumab emtansine treatment until the antiretroviral drug is cleared from the circulation (approximately 4 elimination half-lives), if possible. If trastuzumab emtansine cannot be delayed, monitor closely for toxicity.",(See Summary)
745,Saquinavir (SQV),Trastuzumab,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal IgG antibody. Elimination is similar to endogenous IgG and occurs primarily via proteolytic catabolism.,(See Summary)
746,Saquinavir (SQV),Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Ascorbic acid is oxidised to dehydroascorbic acid where some is metabolised to oxalic acid and the inactive ascorbate-2-sulphate. Large doses are rapidly excreted in the urine when in excess of the requirements of the body. Saquinavir does not interfere with this metabolic pathway.,(See Summary)
747,Saquinavir (SQV),Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. Inhibition of CYP3A by saquinavir is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known. However, no effect of antiretroviral therapy on the response to vitamin D supplementation was found in a PK modelling study.","Pharmacokinetic modelling of vitamin D3 supplementation from 422 HIV-infected patients showed no significant differences in concentrations of 25-hydroxycolecalciferol related to antiretroviral drugs.Vitamin D3 supplementation scheme in HIV-infected patients based upon pharmacokinetic modelling of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol.

752,Saquinavir (SQV),Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Pyridoxine is absorbed from the GI tract and is converted to the active form pyridoxal phosphate. It is excreted in the urine as 4-pyridoxic acid.,(See Summary)
753,Saquinavir (SQV),Retinol (Vitamin A) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. A clinical study demonstrated that ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir increased the activity of retinal dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV. HIV-protease inhibitors alter retinoic acid synthesis. AIDS. 2001 Oct 19;15(15):1979-84."

756,Saquinavir (SQV),Eletriptan,Do Not Coadminister,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Eletriptan is metabolised by CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by saquinavir. Coadministration with ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased eletriptan Cmax and AUC by 2.7 and 5.9 fold, respectively. The US product label for eletriptan contraindicates its use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors whereas the European product label advises that it should not be used with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.",(See Summary)
