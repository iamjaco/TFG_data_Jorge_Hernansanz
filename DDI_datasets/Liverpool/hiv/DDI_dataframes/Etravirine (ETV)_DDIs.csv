13,Etravirine (ETV),Albendazole,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. When antiepileptics (phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) were coadministered with albendazole, significantly reduced levels of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide were observed, apparently due to induction of CYP3A4. Similarly, coadministration with etravirine could reduce albendazole exposure; however, the clinical relevance is unknown as the antihelmintic action is thought to be mainly intra-intestinal.","Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital appear to induce the oxidative metabolism of albendazole via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A by roughly the same extent, resulting in significantly reduced concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide. This interaction is likely to be clinically significant when albendazole is used to treat systemic worm infections, and increased doses of albendazole would be needed. The interaction is probably not clinically significant when albendazole is used for intestinal worm infections.Lanchote VL, et al.

49,Etravirine (ETV),Artemisinin,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Artemisinins undergo rapid metabolism via several CYP450 (CYP3A4, 2A6, 2B6) and the active metabolite (dihydroartemisinin, which has greater potency than the parent drug) is further metabolism via UGT1A9 and 2B7. Etravirine could potentially increase the conversion of artemether and arteether to the active metabolite. The clinical relevance is unclear.

The authors hypothesized an increased exposure to N-desmethylclobazam due to induction of CYP3A4 and inhibition of CYP2C19 by etravirine. Monitor for clobazam toxicity and consider a dose reduction of clobazam if indicated. Clobazam is unlikely to affect etravirine. ","A case was reported of a 47-year-old HIV positive man treated with valproic acid (2.5 g, once a day) and clobazam (10 mg, twice daily) whose ART was switched from lamivudine/zidovudine, tenofovir, raltegravir and lopinavir/ritonavir to tenofovir/emtricitabine, raltegravir, lopinavir/ritonavir and etravirine. After a month he reported unsteady gait, weakness, slurred speech and excessive daytime somnolence. He was found to have elevated anticonvulsant concentrations and his medication was reduced to 2 g valproic acid and 10 mg clobazam, both once daily.

332,Etravirine (ETV),Heroin,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin but etravirine is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1).

345,Etravirine (ETV),Ifosfamide,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of etravirine via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Pretreatment with the CYP3A inducer dexamethasone proportionally decreased the AUC for both ifosfamide metabolites. induction of CYP2B enzymes by high-dose phenobarbital pretreatment significantly decreased the fraction of ifosfamide undergoing 4-hydroxylation from 37% to 22% of total metabolism. As etravirine is an enzyme inducer, there is potential for ifosfamide levels to be reduced if coadministered.","The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites.

In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

Pretreatment with the P450 3A inducer dexamethasone proportionally decreased the AUC for both IF metabolites, without any net impact on the fraction of IF undergoing metabolic activation. These findings demonstrate specific roles for P450 2B and 3A enzymes in catalysing these pathways of IF metabolism in vivo.

In vitro data indicate that imatinib inhibits CYPs 3A4, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. Etravirine could potentially decrease imatinib exposure (induction of CYP3A4), potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. The US Prescribing Information suggests considering alternative therapeutic agents with less enzyme induction potential when CYP3A4 inducers are indicated. Imatinib may increase exposure of CYP3A4 substrates, such as etravirine.","Substances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity may significantly reduce exposure to imatinib, potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. Pre-treatment with multiple doses of rifampicin 600 mg followed by a single 400 mg dose of imatinib resulted in decrease in Cmax and AUC by at least 54% and 74%, of the respective values without rifampicin treatment. Similar results were observed in patients with malignant gliomas treated with imatinib while taking enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) such as carbazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin. The plasma AUC for imatinib decreased by 73% compared to patients not on EIAEDs. Concomitant use of rifampicin or other strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be avoided. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolised drugs.Glivec Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, October 2012.Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with multiple doses of rifampin followed by a single dose of imatinib, increased imatinib oral-dose clearance by 3.8-fold, which significantly (p<0.05) decreased mean Cmax and AUC. Similar findings were observed in patients receiving 400-1200 mg/day imatinib concomitantly with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED) (e.g., carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone). The mean dose normalized AUC for imatinib in the patients receiving EIAED’s decreased by 73% compared to patients not receiving EIAED. Concomitant administration of imatinib and St. John’s Wort led to a 30% reduction in the AUC of imatinib. Consider alternative therapeutic agents with less enzyme induction potential in patients when rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers are indicated. Imatinib doses up to 1200 mg/day (600 mg BID) have been given to patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib.

The first case had raltegravir trough concentrations of 189 and 313 ng/ml on two occasions whilst on darunavir/ritonavir, enfuvirtide and raltegravir. After switching enfuvirtide for etravirine, raltegravir trough concentrations decreased to 10 ng/ml and then to 5 ng/ml one month later. The second case started a combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine, etravirine and raltegravir. Tenofovir trough concentrations were in the expected range, but raltegravir trough concentrations were considered low (30 ng/ml). Increasing raltegravir from 800 mg/day to 1200 mg/day resulted in an increase in trough concentration (67 ng/ml). The third case had low raltegravir trough concentrations on two occasions (12 and 9 ng/ml) whilst receiving darunavir/ritonavir, etravirine and raltegravir. The final case switched to tenofovir, etravirine and raltegravir. Etravirine trough concentrations were within the normal range, but raltegravir trough concentrations were low (29 ng/ml).

Scholler-Gyure M, Kakuda TN, van Solingen-Ristea R, et al. 49th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, San Francisco, September 2009, abstract A1-1299.  A case report describes a 54-year-old HIV-positive Caucasian male receiving darunavir/ritonavir (900/100 mg once daily) with etravirine (200 mg twice daily) and tenofovir/emtricitabine who was treated for Aspergillus fumigatus with voriconazole 400 mg i.v. twice daily (days 1-7), caspofungin 50 mg i.v. daily (days 8-25) and voriconazole 400 mg orally twice daily (days 12-45).  Etravirine, darunavir and ritonavir were continued; however, tenofovir/emtricitabine was stopped due to acute renal failure (replaced by abacavir/lamivudine). The patient responded to antifungal therapy with no hepatic or visual toxicity and was discharged after 46 days hospitalization.  Trough concentrations of voriconazole, etravirine, darunavir and ritonavir were measured after 3 weeks on oral voriconazole therapy and repeated 3 weeks after voriconazole discontinuation.  Voriconazole concentrations were at the upper end of the therapeutic range, but etravirine trough concentrations increased by 134% when on voriconazole.  Ritonavir trough concentration was undetectable and darunavir trough concentration was below the historical reference Cmin while receiving voriconazole. The authors postulate that low ritonavir exposure resulted in diminished darunavir boosting, or that the increased etravirine concentration led to a greater induction effect on darunavir.
