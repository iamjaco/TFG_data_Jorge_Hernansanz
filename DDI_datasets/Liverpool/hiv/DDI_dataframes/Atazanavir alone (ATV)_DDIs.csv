0,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Abacavir (ABC),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration with atazanavir alone has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Coadministration of abacavir (600 mg once daily) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) had no effect on atazanavir or ritonavir pharmacokinetics, but decreased abacavir AUC (17%) and Cmax (20%). These changes are unlikely to be clinically significant.","Abacavir has also been shown in vitro not to inhibit CYP 3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Induction of hepatic metabolism has not been observed in clinical studies.

3,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Acenocoumarol,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Atazanavir does not inhibit or induce these CYPs in the range of clinical concentrations.,(See Summary)
4,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Acetazolamide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acetazolamide is primarily excreted unchanged via the kidneys.,(See Summary)
5,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Aciclovir (Acyclovir),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolism and clearance a clinically significant drug-drug interaction is unlikely as aciclovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1. Atazanavir is unlikely to inhibit OATs at clinically relevant concentrations.,(See Summary)

11,Atazanavir alone (ATV),African Potato,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. African potato was shown to inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp in vitro and to activate PXR suggesting that inhibition may occur initially followed by induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp when used for extended periods. Coadministration of African potato with lopinavir/ritonavir in healthy volunteers did not result in significant pharmacokinetic changes suggesting that boosting by ritonavir could offset the inducing effect of African potato. Consider administrating atazanavir with ritonavir or cobicistat.,(See Summary)
12,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Agomelatine,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as agomelatine is metabolised predominantly via CYP1A2. Atazanavir does not inhibit or induce CYP1A2 at clinically relevant concentrations.",(See Summary)
13,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Albendazole,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 and the flavine-containing monooxygenase system are involved in the formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. Short term (2 doses) coadministration with ritonavir (200 mg) did not impact albendazole pharmacokinetics whereas long-term coadministration (8 days) decreased albendazole exposure likely due to ritonavir inducing effect. Atazanavir has no inducing effect and therefore atazanavir alone is not expected to significantly impact albendazole when administered long-term.,"In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400 mg albendazole, in the absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir.Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

14,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Albuvirtide,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Albuvirtide is a peptide which is eliminated by catabolism to its constituent amino acids. Based on data from studies with lopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations of atazanavir may decrease but this is not expected to be clinically relevant. Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. However, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone (lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 37%, 33% and 35%, respectively; ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 38%, 39% and 28%, respectively). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 Âµg/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy. Furthermore, a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study) showed that albuvirtide + lopinavir/ritonavir was non-inferior to the standard second-line regimen lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine in HIV infected Chinese individuals suggesting that this interaction has no clinical consequences. In vitro human microsomal studies indicate that albuvirtide has no inducing properties on P450 enzymes. In addition, albuvirtide binds to <1% of serum albumin in the range of clinical concentrations, thus the observed decrease in lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations is unlikely to result from protein binding displacement. However, binding of the albuvirtide-albumin complex to the HIV protease inhibitor cannot be excluded.","Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 9 HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. Conversely, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone. The mean ratios (90% CI) of AUC, Cmax and Ctrough for lopinavir were 0.63 (0.49-0.82), 0.67 (053-0.86) and 0.65 (0.46-0.91). For ritonavir, AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 0.62 (0.42-0.91), 0.61 (0.38-0.99) and 0.72 (0.40-1.26). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 ug/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy.Evaluation of pharmacokinetic interactions between long-acting HIV-1 fusion inhibitor albuvirtide and lopinavir/ritonavir, in HIV-infected subjects, combined with clinical study and simulation results.

Xenobiotica. 2017, 47(2): 133-143.The safety and efficacy of albuvirtide plus lopinavir-ritonavir in antiretroviral-experienced Chinese adults with HIV-1 was assessed in a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study). Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive albuvirtide (once weekly) plus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (albuvirtide) or WHO-recommended second-line treatment (lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine; control). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma viral load <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Non-inferiority was pre-specified with a margin of 12%. Interim analysis of 48 week data from 46 subjects in the albuvirtide group and 50 patients in the control group showed 80.4% patients in the albuvirtide group had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL versus 66.0% in the control group (difference 14.4%, 95% CI -3.0% -31.9%), meeting the non-inferiority criteria.Efficacy and safety of long-acting HIV fusion inhibitor albuvirtide in antiretroviral-experienced adults with HIV-1: interim 48-week results from the randomized, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority TALENT study.

65,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Beclometasone,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro data indicate that beclometasone is a pro-drug which is hydrolysed via esterase enzymes to the highly active metabolite beclometasone-17-monopropionate. This active metabolite is subsequently converted to inactive metabolites via CYP3A4/5. Coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (160 mg twice daily) increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate by 108% and 67%, respectively. However, coadministration of a boosted PI (darunavir/ritonavir, 600/100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. Although statistically significant, the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir is unlikely to be of clinical significance as no significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir. Use the lowest possible corticosteroid dose with caution and monitor for corticosteroid side effects.","Concomitant use of Reyataz/ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression. A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., beclomethasone).

74,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Betamethasone,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Betamethasone is metabolized by CYP3A4 and coadministration may therefore lead to elevated corticosteroid levels, Cushingâs syndrome and adrenal axis suppression. A case of Cushingâs syndrome and adrenal suppression in a patient on atazanavir/ritonavir and dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops and betamethasone 0.1% eye ointment has been reported. Betamethasone is a moderate inducer of CYP3A4. Caution is needed when betamethasone is administered orally or intravenously at high doses or for a long duration as it may decrease atazanavir exposure.","A case report describes a 51-year-old woman with HIV who presented with weight gain and a 1-month history of right hip pain. Her ART included tenofovir (300 mg once daily), emtricitabine (200 mg once daily), and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily). Because of previous bilateral cytomegalovirus retinitis, complicated by immune recovery uveitis with severe, chronic, cystoid macular oedema, she was also using dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops six times daily, and betamethasone 0.1% eye ointment at night, in both eyes. On examination, she was noted to have central adiposity and enlargement of the dorsocervical fat, but no peripheral lipoatrophy. An MRI scan of the hip showed avascular necrosis. A tetracosactide (Synacthen) stimulation test showed marked suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis, with a baseline cortisol of less than 25 nmol/L rising to only 37 nmol/l 30 min after administration of tetracosactide 250mg (normal response at 30 min, >570 nmol/L). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was undetectable. The presence of adrenal axis suppression with low ACTH, in the context of Cushingoid features and avascular necrosis of the hip, suggested ongoing exposure to high systemic levels of exogenous corticosteroids. Ritonavir and atazanavir were substituted with efavirenz (600 mg once daily) while continuing the steroid eye drops. Oral hydrocortisone 15 mg daily was added to avoid precipitating crisis due to adrenal insufficiency. Over the following year, the patientâs weight declined, with marked improvement in her adrenal function. Analysis of stored serum samples revealed elevated levels of dexamethasone at presentation (1.4-1.7 nmol/L) which fell dramatically after discontinuation of protease inhibitor therapy (undetectable to 0.181 nmol/L). Although prior courses of oral and intravenous corticosteroids may have contributed to adrenal axis suppression, the close temporal correlation between discontinuation of ritonavir, reversal of weight gain and recovery of adrenal function, combined with detectable levels of dexamethasone in the blood, strongly suggests that co-administration of ritonavir was responsible for the accumulation of excessive systemic levels of topical ocular corticosteroids, resulting in adrenal axis suppression and Cushingâs syndrome.Cushingâs syndrome and adrenal axis suppression in a patient treated with ritonavir and corticosteroid eye drops.

Furthermore, patients should be monitored closely and any signs or symptoms of blood loss should be evaluated promptly. Betrixaban has demonstrated an exposure dependent increase in QT interval therefore caution is required when coadministering with another drug that may prolong the QTc interval. Of note, coadministration of betrixaban might need to be reconsidered in patients with concomitant renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/ml) as renal impairment per se does increase betrixaban exposure.",(See Summary)

Enhanced levodopa effects including severe dyskinesia were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsons's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsonâs had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in the daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Ciclesonide can be administered with atazanavir without dose adjustment, but with close monitoring. There is a risk of steroid side effects occurring, particularly if a high dose is used, or in case of prolonged administration, or if used with another medicine containing corticosteroids. These side effects are also more likely during periods of physiological stress. Ciclesonide is a pro-drug activated by esterases in the lungs to des-ciclesonide which then undergoes CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 7 days) with orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 Âµg once daily) did not alter ciclesonide but resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the AUC and a 2-fold increase in the Cmax of des-ciclesonide. Ciclesonide is mainly absorbed by the lungs, has a high protein binding and a high clearance resulting in a lower potential to cause systemic effects compared to some other inhaled corticosteroids.

146,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Clopidogrel,Do Not Coadminister,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but is not recommended. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. Atazanavir inhibits CYP3A4, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir and cobicistat) have been shown to decrease clopidogrel exposure. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrelâs active metabolite both by 69% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). In HIV-negative subjects (n=12), coadministration of clopidogrel and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrelâs active metabolite by 51% and 48%. Importantly, the decrease in clopidogrelâs active metabolite lead to insufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation in 44% of the patients treated with clopidogrel and ritonavir or cobicistat. Consistently, the study in HIV-negative subjects showed that the average inhibition of platelet aggregation was decreased from 51% (clopidogrel alone) to 31% (clopidogrel + ritonavir). Of interest, the study with HIV-infected patients showed a comparable decrease in prasugrelâs active metabolite AUC (52% decrease), however this decrease did not impair prasugrelâs antiplatelet effect. The differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect is in line with clinical observations. Early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Taken together these data suggest that given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of atazanavir, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites. Marsousi N, Daali Y, Fontana P, et al. Clin Pharmacokinet, 2018, 57(10):1347-1354.The impact of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel active metabolite (AM) and the pharmacodynamic effect was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Subjects ingested either placebo or clopidogrel (300 mg followed by 75 mg the two following days) alone and together with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Ritonavir significantly decreased the exposure of clopidogrel AM by 51% and average platelet inhibition significantly decreased from 51% without ritonavir to 31% with ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -27% to -12%). The maximal platelet inhibition by clopidogrel was also reduced from 60% to 40% during concurrent ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -29% to -11%). The authors conclude that patients receiving ritonavir are at risk for diminished clopidogrel response and consequently increased risk for atherothrombotic events if the two drugs are used concurrently.

Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. Inhibition of CYP3A by atazanavir is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known.

Dabigatran is a substrate of P-pg and atazanavir is an inhibitor of P-gp. Pharmacokinetic interactions were observed with simultaneous or separated administration with other P-gp inhibitors - ritonavir had no effect or decreased dabigatran AUC (due to the mixed induction and inhibition of intestinal P-gp by ritonavir), but cobicistat increased dabigatran AUC by 110-127% (due to inhibition of intestinal P-gp). Similarly to atazanavir/cobicistat, unboosted atazanavir has no inducing effects and therefore is expected to increase dabigatran exposure and result in a more pronounced anticoagulant response; therefore, coadministration is not recommended.","Coadministration of dabigatran (150 mg single dose) simultaneously with or 2 h before ritonavir alone (100 mg once daily administered at steady state) or cobicistat alone (150 mg, once daily) was studied in 16 HIV negative subjects. Simultaneous administration with ritonavir did not significantly change dabigatran PK (possibly due to mixed induction and inhibition of P-gp by ritonavir). Administration 2 hours before ritonavir decreased dabigatran AUC by 29% and Cmax by 27%. Dabigatran AUC and Cmax increased by 110% and 99%, respectively, when dabigatran was administered 2 h before cobicistat, and both increased by 127% when the two drugs were coadministered simultaneously. The mechanism of the cobicistat interaction is likely intestinal P-gp inhibition by cobicistat. These results suggest that dabigatran can be administered simultaneously with ritonavir used as a once daily pharmacokinetic enhancer but that cobicistat may require a dose reduction and clinical monitoring.Cobicistat, but not ritonavir, increases dabigatran exposure.

182,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Diamorphine (diacetylmorphine),Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Diamorphine is rapidly metabolized by sequential deacetylation to morphine which is then mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). Atazanavir does not inhibit or induce UGT2B7. However, morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS due to inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier. Monitor for signs of opiate toxicity.",(See Summary)
183,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Diazepam,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Diazepam is metabolized to nordiazepam (by CYPs 3A4 and 2C19) and to temazepam (mainly by CYP3A4). Atazanavir could potentially increase diazepam exposure by inhibition of CYP3A4. This could prolong sedation and a dosage reduction may be required.,(See Summary)

When coadministered with didanosine, atazanavir should be given with food 2 h before or 1 h after didanosine. The buffered formulation of didanosine, but not the enteric coated formulation, decreased atazanavir concentrations. Didanosine concentrations were decreased in the presence of food.","Didanosine should be taken at the fasted state 2 hours after Reyataz taken with food. Coadministration of didanosine (buffered tablets; 200 mg, single dose) and stavudine (40 mg single dose) with atazanavir (400 mg single dose) was studied in healthy volunteers. With simultaneous administration (fasted), atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased 87%, 89% and 84%, respectively. When atazanavir was dose 1 hour after didanosine and stavudine (fasted), atazanavir AUC and Cmin were unchanged, while Cmax increased 12%. Atazanavir concentrations were greatly decreased when coadministered with didanosine (buffered tablets) and stavudine. The mechanism of interaction is a reduced solubility of atazanavir with increasing pH related to the presence of anti-acid agent in didanosine buffered tablets. No significant effect on didanosine and stavudine concentrations was observed. Coadministration of didanosine (enteric coated capsules; 400 mg single dose, with food) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily) was studied in healthy volunteers. Didanosine AUC and Cmax decreased 34%, 38% and Cmin increased 25%. No significant effect on atazanavir concentrations was observed when administered with enteric-coated didanosine, but administration with food decreased didanosine concentrations.Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, October 2018.Atazanavir solubility decreases as pH increases. Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if buffered medications are administered with Reyataz. Coadministration of Reyataz with didanosine buffered tablets resulted in a marked decrease in atazanavir exposure. It is recommended that Reyataz be given (with food) 2 h before or 1 h after didanosine buffered formulations. Simultaneous administration of didanosine EC and Reyataz with food results in a decrease in didanosine exposure. Thus, Reyataz and didanosine EC should be administered at different times. Coadministration of didanosine (buffered tablets; 200 mg, single dose) and stavudine (40 mg single dose) with atazanavir (400 mg single dose) was studied in healthy volunteers. With simultaneous administration (n=31, fasted), atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased 89%, 87% and 84%, respectively. When atazanavir was dosed 1 hour after didanosine and stavudine (n=32, fasted), atazanavir Cmax increased 12% and AUC and Cmin both increased 3%. Reyataz did not have a significant effect on the exposures of didanosine (when administered as the buffered tablet). Coadministration of didanosine (400 mg, enteric-coated capsules, single dose, fed) with atazanavir (400 mg, once daily) was studied in 34 healthy volunteers.

On day 15 or 22, patients received 100 mg i.v. docetaxel. Docetaxel AUC in patients who received 10 mg oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was low, and the dose could safely be increased to 100 mg. The AUC in patients who received 100 mg oral docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was 2.4 Â± 1.5 and 2.8 Â± 1.4 mg/L.h, respectively, compared with 1.9 Â± 0.4 mg/L.h after i.v. docetaxel. The apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was >100% (i.e. 131 Â± 90% and 161 Â± 91%, respectively), indicating marked inhibition by ritonavir of gut wall and/or hepatic metabolism.

(These results are when compared to atazanavir 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg all as a single dose with food. When compared to atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg without tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, atazanavir concentrations are expected to be additionally decreased by about 20%.) The mechanism of interaction is decreased solubility of atazanavir as intra-gastric pH increases with H2-blockers. For patients who are taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, if Reyataz/ritonavir with both tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and an H2-receptor antagonist are coadministered, a dose increase of Reyataz to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir is recommended. A dose equivalent to famotidine 40 mg twice daily should not be exceeded. Co-administration of Reyataz without ritonavir and famotidine is not recommended but if required, atazanavir without ritonavir should be administered either 2 hours after famotidine or 12 hours before. No single dose of famotidine should exceed 20 mg, and the total daily dose of famotidine should not exceed 40 mg.Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, October 2018.Atazanavir solubility decreases as pH increases. Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if H2-receptor antagonists are administered with Reyataz. Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when Reyataz 400 mg once daily was administered simultaneously with famotidine 40 mg twice daily in adults, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. In treatment-naive adult patients: Reyataz 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food should be administered simultaneously with, and/or at least 10 hours after, a dose of the H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA). Famotidine 20 mg once daily up to 40 mg twice daily can be used with Reyataz 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg in treatment-naÃ¯ve patients. For treatment-naÃ¯ve patients unable to tolerate ritonavir, Reyataz 400 mg once daily with food should be administered at least 2 hours before and at least 10 hours after a dose of the H2RA. No single dose should exceed famotidine 20 mg, and the total daily dose should not exceed famotidine 40 mg. The use of Reyataz without ritonavir in pregnant women is not recommended.In treatment-experienced adult patients: whenever an H2RA is given to a patient receiving Reyataz with ritonavir, the H2RA dose should not exceed famotidine 20 mg twice daily, and the Reyataz and ritonavir doses should be administered simultaneously with, and/or at least 10 hours after, the dose of the H2RA.â¢ Reyataz 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with an H2RA.â¢ Reyataz 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with both tenofovir DF and an H2RA.â¢ Reyataz 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with either tenofovir DF or an H2RA for pregnant women during the second and third trimester.

Cmax and AUC increased 2% and 3%, respectively while Cmin decreased 14%.Reyataz US Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2018.Two studies were designed to evaluate the effect of the H2 antagonist famotidine (40 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of ATV in groups of healthy subjects (n=16). In one study, subjects received ATV 400 mg alone for 6 days, followed by either ATV + famotidine together, ATV + famotidine + cola together, ATV + famotidine separated (10 h post morning ATV dose and 2 h prior to evening ATV dose), or ATV 300 mg twice daily + famotidine + RTV (100 mg twice daily). In the second study, following 10 days of ATV/RTV (300/100 mg twice daily), subjects received ATV/RTV + famotidine, ATV/RTV + famotidine + cola, or ATV/RTV (400/100 mg) + famotidine. When compared to ATV 400 mg alone, the addition of famotidine reduced ATV AUC and Cmin by 41% and 42% respectively. Separating the administration of ATV and famotidine reduced the effect on AUC and Cmin (GMR 0.95 and 0.79 respectively). The addition of RTV to ATV 300 mg with famotidine resulted in increased AUC (79%) and Cmin (546%). Relative to a boosted 300/100 mg regimen, famotidine reduced ATV AUC and Cmin by 18% and 28% respectively. Increasing ATV to 400 mg when given with famotidine and RTV produced similar AUC and Cmin (GMR 1.03 and 0.86 respectively). The administration of cola did not mitigate the effects of famotidine in either study. The authors concluded that patients receiving ATV 400 mg unboosted and who require famotidine can either switch to ATV/RTV 300/100 mg twice daily, or remain on an unboosted regimen, but take famotidine 10 h after and 2 h prior to ATV. Patients on boosted ATV regimens (ATV/RTV 300/100 mg twice daily) should increase ATV to 400/100 mg when given with famotidine.Â Pharmacokinetic effect of famotidine on atazanavir with and without ritonavir in healthy subjects. Agarwala, S et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 11.Trough atazanavir concentrations were available in 15 patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and 19 patients receiving an H2 receptor antagonist (H2). The mean atazanavir trough concentration in the PPI group was 0.65 Âµg/ml (range <0.05 to 1.85 Âµg/ml) compared to 1.12 Âµg/ml (range <0.05 to 3.17 Âµg/ml) in the H2 group. Concentrations were below target (0.27 Âµg/ml) in 6/15 in the PPI group, even though 5 of these were receiving boosted atazanavir. Inadequate levels were observed in 4/20 in the H2 group, 2 of whom were receiving boosted atazanavir. These results suggest a negative effect of proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists on atazanavir concentrations and that boosting with ritonavir does not ensure adequate concentrations. Further study of this important issue is warranted.Â Coadministration of atazanavir with proton-pump inhibitors and H2-blockers.

272,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Fentanyl,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Fentanyl undergoes extensive CYP3A4 metabolism. Coadministration may increase fentanyl concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of fentanyl until stable drug effects are achieved. Discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease fentanyl concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. When discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors in fentanyl-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur. Note, the use of fentanyl in a non-therapeutic setting (i.e., as a recreational drug) should be avoided with atazanavir as fentanyl exposure is expected to significantly increase and serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur.

343,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Ifosfamide,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. Thus, there is potential for ifosfamide to decrease levels of unboosted atazanavir. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as atazanavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.","In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks.

Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely.

Ketoconazole increased imatinib exposure; however, ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) had no significant effect on imatinib exposure. Use with caution and monitor for imatinib related side effects. Imatinib may increase exposure of CYP3A4 substrates, such as atazanavir.","Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg).

Parkinsonâs had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Period I was atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily); period II was atazanavir (300 mg once daily) plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily); period III was atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on the last day of each dosing period. The main findings were: atazanavir Cmin was 45% higher in period II vs period I, AUC did not differ and there was a trend to lower Cmax; the additional ritonavir in period III did not significantly increase atazanavir Cmin, AUC or Cmax compared to period II; the additional ritonavir in period III increased lopinavir Cmin by 28% compared with period II. The authors conclude that a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) plus atazanavir (300 mg once daily) gives appropriate pharmacokinetic profiles and could be further evaluated in treatment-experienced patients.Â Beneficial pharmacokinetic interaction between atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir.

492,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Norgestimate (COC),Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration of atazanavir with a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing norgestimate has not been studied. Norgestimate is deacetylated to the active metabolite norelgestromin which is then possibly metabolized by CYP3A4 to norgestrel. Contrary to ritonavir, atazanavir does not induce glucuronidation and is predicted to increase norelgestromin and ethinylestradiol exposure. The US Prescribing Information for atazanavir recommends that if atazanavir is administered without a pharmacoenhancer, the oral contraceptive should contain no more than 30 Âµg of ethinylestradiol.","Coadministration of ethinylestradiol (25 Âµg) and norgestimate with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily) was studied in healthy volunteers. Ethinylestradiol AUC, Cmax and Cmin were decreased 19%, 16% and 37%, respectively. Norgestimate AUC, Cmax and Cmin were increased 85%, 68% and 102%, respectively. While the concentration of ethinylestradiol was increased with atazanavir given alone, due to both UGT and CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir, the net effect of atazanavir/ritonavir is a decrease in ethinylestradiol levels because of the inducing effect of ritonavir. Coadministration of ethinylestradiol (35 Âµg) and norethindrone with atazanavir (400 mg, once daily) was studied in healthy volunteers. Ethinylestradiol AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased 48%, 15% and 91%, respectively. Norethindrone AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased 110%, 67% and 262%, respectively. The increase in progestin exposure may lead to related side-effects (e.g. insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, acne and spotting), thus possibly affecting the compliance. If an oral contraceptive is administered with Reyataz/ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain at least 30 Î¼g of ethinylestradiol and that the patient be reminded of strict compliance with this contraceptive dosing regimen. Coadministration of Reyataz/ritonavir with other hormonal contraceptives or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate has not been studied, and therefore should be avoided. An alternate reliable method of contraception is recommended.Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, October 2018.Coadministration of ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate (Ortho Tri-Cyclen, once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily) was studied in 14 healthy volunteers. All subjects were on a 28-day lead-in period; one full cycle of Ortho Tri-Cyclen (containing 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol) following by Ortho Tri-Cyclen LO (containing 25 mcg of ethinyl estradiol). Results were dose normalized to an ethinyl estradiol dose of 35 mcg. Ethinyl estradiol Cmax, AUC and Cmin were decreased 16%, 19% and 37%, respectively. Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 17-deacetyl norgestimate (the active component of norgestimate) were increased 68%, 85% and 102%, respectively. Upon further dose normalization of ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg with atazanavir/ritonavir relative to ethinyl estradiol 25 mcg without atazanavir/ritonavir, the ratio of geometric means (90% confidence intervals) for Cmax, AUC, and Cmin were 1.17 (1.03, 1.34), 1.13 (1.05, 1.22), and 0.88 (0.77, 1.00), respectively.

554,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Prasugrel,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Prasugrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6.

However this decrease did not impair prasugrelâs antiplatelet effect. This same study showed that clopidogrel effect was altered by either cobicistat and ritonavir therefore prasugrel should be preferred, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects.

However, the US Prescribing Information recommends to consider alternative antiretroviral therapy in patients already receiving quetiapine to avoid increases in quetiapine exposures but if coadministration is necessary, to reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adverse reactions. For initiation of quetiapine in patients taking atazanavir, the US label recommends to refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine. Since both drugs can potentially prolong the QT interval, ECG monitoring is recommended if coadministered.","Coadministration with medicinal products that are substrates of the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450 and have narrow therapeutic windows (e.g. quetiapine) is contraindicated.

A 57-year-old male with HIV and bipolar disease developed rapid and severe weight gain when quetiapine was added to a stable atazanavir/ritonavir-based antiretroviral regimen. After discontinuation of both quetiapine and ritonavir, his weight returned to its baseline value. The second patient (32-year-old female with HIV, anxiety disorder, and a history of intravenous drug abuse) developed increased sedation and mental confusion when an atazanavir/ritonavir-based antiretroviral regimen was added to her stable anti-anxiety drug regimen, which included quetiapine. Her symptoms resolved promptly after discontinuation of the quetiapine. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated that the adverse effects experienced by the two patients were possibly related and probably related, respectively, to an interaction between quetiapine and atazanavir/ritonavir.

Coadministration of sorafenib and ritonavir in patients with Kaposi sarcoma did not significantly alter the exposure of sorafenib, however, a decrease in sorafenib-N-oxide (CYP3A4 mediated metabolite) was noted. The study had to be terminated early due to poor tolerance, which could possibly be related to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir leading to the formation of more toxic metabolites. A similar effect may occur due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by atazanavir. Use with caution if coadministered due to poor tolerability. In addition, both atazanavir and sorafenib have been shown to prolong the QT/QTc interval.","Coadministration of sorafenib with ritonavir was studied in patients with Kaposi sarcoma in a parallel study.

Sorafenib AUC was unaffected by ritonavir coadministration, but a decreasing trend in sorafenib-N-oxide (CYP3A4 metabolite) AUC was noted. Sorafenib was poorly tolerated, and the study terminated early. The authors suggest that ritonavir may contribute to sorafenib toxicity by inhibition of CYP3A4, shunting of metabolism towards other pathways yielding more toxic metabolites that could possibly explain the toxicity observed.

When coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, it is recommended that Reyataz 300 mg be given with ritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (all as a single dose with food). Patients should be closely monitored for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-associated adverse reactions, including renal disorders. Reyataz given without ritonavir should not be considered in patients treated with a backbone regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil.Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, October 2018.Tenofovir DF may decrease the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir. When coadministered with tenofovir DF in adults, it is recommended that Reyataz 300 mg be given with ritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir DF 300 mg (all as a single daily dose with food). Reyataz increases tenofovir concentrations. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher tenofovir concentrations could potentiate tenofovir-associated adverse reactions, including renal disorders. Patients receiving Reyataz and tenofovir DF should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg, once daily) with atazanavir (400 mg, once daily) was studied in 34 healthy volunteers. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased 21%, 25% and 40%, respectively. Tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased 14%, 24%, and 22%, respectively (n=33). Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg, once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily) was studied in 12 healthy volunteers. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased 28%, 25% and 23%, respectively (n=10). Tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased 34%, 37% and 29%, respectively. Note that similar results were observed in studies where administration of tenofovir DF and Reyataz was separated by 12 hours. Atazanavir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg results in higher atazanavir exposure than atazanavir 400 mg. The geometric mean values of atazanavir pharmacokinetic parameters when coadministered with ritonavir and tenofovir DF were: Cmax = 3190 ng/mL, AUC = 34459 ng.h/mL, and Cmin = 491 ng/mL. Study was conducted in HIV-infected individuals.Reyataz US Prescribing Information Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2018.Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily for 14 days) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) to 33 subjects increased tenofovir Cmax (14%), AUC (24%) and Cmin (22%). Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 21%, 25% and 40% respectively. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily for 42 days) increased tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 34%, 37% and 29%, respectively; atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 28%, 25%, and 23%, respectively. In HIV-infected patients, the addition of tenofovir-DF to atazanavir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg, resulted in AUC and Cmin values of atazanavir that were 2.3- and 4-fold higher than the respective values observed for atazanavir 400 mg when given alone. When coadministered with tenofovir-DF, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. Tenofovir-DF should not be coadministered with atazanavir without ritonavir. Patients receiving tenofovir-DF concomitantly with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Tenofovir-DF should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse reactions.Â Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc., February 2016.Atazanavir trough concentrations were determined in 43 HIV+ subjects receiving unboosted atazanavir (400 mg once daily) in the presence of tenofovir-DF. The median trough concentration was 242 (range 106-1100) ng/ml with 8 subjects having low trough concentrations (<150 ng/ml). Following a dose increase to 600 mg once daily in 4/8 subjects, atazanavir trough concentrations were 222-294 ng/ml. Viral load results were available for 36 subjects, 31 of whom were undetectable (<50 copies/ml) at baseline. 30 remained <50 copies/ml and all were <100 copies/ml at last follow up. Five subjects had viral loads >50 copies/ml at baseline, of whom 3 were undetectable at last follow up.Â Atazanavir trough levels in patients receiving unboosted atazanavir and tenofovir. Harris M, Hull M, Toy J, et al. 10th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Amsterdam, April 2009, abstract P21.The pharmacokinetic effects of the coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and unboosted atazanavir were studied in HIV-negative subjects. A dosing strategy that would provide atazanavir and tenofovir exposures comparable to each drug when dosed alone was evaluated. The strategies employed were dosing the ATV (400 mg once daily) and TDF 12 hours apart and increasing the ATV dose to 600 mg once daily. The temporal 12-hour separation of ATV 400 mg resulted in a decrease in ATV Cmax, AUC, Cmin of 10%, 17%, and 28%, respectively and an increase in TDF Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 43%, 37%, and 38%, respectively. The simultaneous administration of 600 mg ATV with TDF resulted in a decrease in ATV Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 27%, 36%, and 41%, respectively and an increase in TDF Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 41%, 59%, and 74%, respectively. Based on these findings the authors continue to recommend that when co-dosed with TDF, ATV (300 mg once daily) should be combined with RTV (100 mg once daily).Â Pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and atazanavir in healthy subjects. Agarwala S, et al. 3rd IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment, Rio de Janiero, July 2005, abstract WePe3.3C07.The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) with tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and/or ddI-EC were investigated in 36 healthy subjects. Addition of tenofovir-DF decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin (21%, 25% and 40% respectively); tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin were increased by 1.14-, 1.24- and 1.22-fold respectively in the presence of atazanavir. In the presence of tenofovir-DF and ddI-EC (250 mg once daily with food), atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 24%, 26% and 39% respectively (compared to atazanavir alone); tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased 1.12-, 1.25- and 1.25-fold respectively (compared to tenofovir alone).Â Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the combination of atazanavir, enteric coated didanosine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for a once daily antiretroviral regimen.

Vinblastine is metabolised by CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4, resulting in the potential for increased incidence of adverse events. Coadministration of vinblastine with protease inhibitors was independently associated with WHO grade III-IV neutropenia in a clinical cohort. Consider temporarily withholding the atazanavir containing antiretroviral regimen in patients who develop significant hematologic or gastrointestinal side effects when atazanavir is coadministered concurrently with vinblastine. If the antiretroviral regimen must be withheld for a prolonged period of time, consider initiating a revised regimen that does not include a CYP3A or P-gp inhibitor.","In order to better define the interaction between combination antiretroviral therapy and vinblastine (a substrate of CYP3A4), clinical charts were reviewed of all HIV infected patients in a centre in Rome who received a diagnosis of Hodgkinâs lymphoma as coadministration of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ritonavir, may decrease vinblastine metabolism and consequently increase vinblastine-related myelosuppression. It was found that the use of protease inhibitors was independently associated with WHO grade III-IV neutropaenia.

727,Atazanavir alone (ATV),Voriconazole,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. The effect of atazanavir on voriconazole exposure is dependent on CYP2C19 metaboliser status. No data are available for coadministration of voriconazole with unboosted atazanavir, but in the majority of patients decreases in both voriconazole and atazanavir exposures may be expected, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance. The European SmPC for atazanavir recommends a patient's CYP2C19 genotype should be performed if feasible. In patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, increased voriconazole exposures are expected.","Co-administration of voriconazole and Reyataz with ritonavir is not recommended, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk justifies the use of voriconazole. In the majority of patients, a reduction in both voriconazole and atazanavir exposures are expected. In the majority of patients with at least one functional CYP2C19 allele, a reduction in both voriconazole and atazanavir exposures are expected. In a small number of patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, significantly increased voriconazole exposures are expected. Coadministration of voriconazole (200 mg, twice daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily) was studied in patients with at least one functional CYP2C19 allele. Voriconazole AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 33%, 10% and 39%, respectively. Atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased 12%, 13% and 20%, respectively. Ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased 12%, 9% and 25%, respectively. Coadministration of voriconazole (50 mg, twice daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily) was studied in patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele. Voriconazole AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 561%, 438% and 765% [sic], respectively. Atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased 20%, 19% and 31%, respectively. Ritonavir AUC and Cmax both decreased 11%, and Cmin decreased 19%. If an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole, at the time voriconazole treatment is required, a patient's CYP2C19 genotype should be performed if feasible. Therefore if the combination is unavoidable, the following recommendations are made according to the CYP2C19 status: in patients with at least one functional CYP2C19 allele, close clinical monitoring for a loss of both voriconazole (clinical signs) and atazanavir (virologic response) efficacy is recommended; in patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, close clinical and laboratory monitoring of voriconazole-associated adverse events is recommended; if genotyping is not feasible, full monitoring of safety and efficacy should be performed. Co-administration of voriconazole and Reyataz without ritonavir may affect atazanavir concentrations.Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, October 2018.Coadministration of Reyataz/ritonavir in subjects with a functional CYP2C19 allele is expected to decrease voriconazole and atazanavir concentrations. Coadministration of Reyataz/ritonavir in subjects without a functional CYP2C19 allele is expected to increase voriconazole concentrations and decrease atazanavir concentrations. The use of voriconazole in patients receiving Reyataz/ritonavir is not recommended unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole. Patients should be carefully monitored for voriconazole-associated adverse reactions and loss of either voriconazole or atazanavir efficacy during the coadministration of voriconazole and Reyataz/ritonavir. Coadministration of voriconazole with Reyataz (without ritonavir) may affect atazanavir concentrations; however, no data are available. Coadministration of voriconazole (200 mg, twice daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg was studied in 20 subjects with at least one functional CYP2C19 allele. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased 13%, 12% and 20%, respectively. Voriconazole Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased 10%, 33% and 39%, respectively. Coadministration of voriconazole (50 mg, twice daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily) was studied in 8 subjects without a functional CYP2C19 allele. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased 19%, 20% and 31%, respectively. Voriconazole Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased 338%, 461% and 665%, respectively.Reyataz US Prescribing Information Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2018.Voriconazole is mainly metabolized by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Due to genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19, voriconazole AUC is on average 2-4 fold higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers (PM) than in extensive metabolisers (EM). In a majority CYP2C19 EM population, low dose ritonavir decreased voriconazole AUC by ~40%, likely due to induction of CYP2C19 by ritonavir. This study assessed the two-way drug interactions when adding voriconazole to atazanavir/ritonavir in both CYP2C19 EM and PM healthy subjects. Voriconazole was administered alone on days 1-3, atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100mg once daily) administered alone on days 11-20, and the drugs coadministered on days 21-30. The voriconazole doses were 200 mg twice daily (400 mg twice daily on days 1 and 21) for EM subjects and 50 mg twice daily (100 mg twice daily on days 1 and 21) for PM subjects. 20 EM and 7 PM subjects completed the study. In EM subjects, coadministration decreased voriconazole AUC and Cmin by 33% and 39%, respectively; atazanavir AUC and Cmin decreased 12% and 20%, respectively. In PM subjects, coadministration increased voriconazole Cmax and AUC by 4-4 fold and 5.6-fold, respectively; atazanavir AUC and Cmin decreased by 20% and 31%, respectively. Ritonavir Cmax and AUC were generally unchanged in either population. The decrease in voriconazole AUC seen in EM subjects, (33%) is similar to the historical observation of 39% when voriconazole was given with low dose ritonavir. In PM subjects, coadministration markedly increased voriconazole exposure, likely through inhibition of CYP3A4.

Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04).
