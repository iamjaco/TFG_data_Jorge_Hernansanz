1,Rilpivirine/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (RPV/FTC/TAF),Acamprosate,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Acamprosate is eliminated unchanged in the urine both via glomerular filtration and active secretion (renal transporter unknown, possibly OATs or OCTs). A clinically significant interaction with rilpivirine is unlikely. Tenofovir alafenamide is unlikely to compete with acamprosate for renal transporters as tenofovir alafenamide results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. However, acamprosate and emtricitabine may compete for tubular secretion, which could lead to increased concentrations of either drug. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown.",(See Summary)
2,Rilpivirine/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (RPV/FTC/TAF),Acarbose,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

3,Rilpivirine/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (RPV/FTC/TAF),Acenocoumarol,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.

4,Rilpivirine/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (RPV/FTC/TAF),Acetazolamide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Acetazolamide is predominantly excreted unchanged via active renal tubular secretion. In vitro studies have shown acetazolamide may competitively inhibit renal transporters OAT1, OAT3 and OAT4. Inhibition of these renal transporters is unlikely to lead to significant increase in tenofovir as tenofovir alafenamide results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. No effect on emtricitabine exposure is expected. Rilpivirine does not interfere with acetazolamide elimination.",(See Summary)
5,Rilpivirine/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (RPV/FTC/TAF),Aciclovir (Acyclovir),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Aciclovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1. Rilpivirine does not interfere with acyclovir elimination. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are unlikely to compete with aciclovir for renal transporters as emtricitabine is eliminated by different renal transporters and tenofovir alafenamide results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. ,"Because emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Odefsey with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of FTC, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions.

11,Rilpivirine/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (RPV/FTC/TAF),African Potato,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. African potato was shown to inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp in vitro and to activate PXR suggesting that inhibition may occur initially followed by induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp when used for extended periods.  Use with caution as African potato could decrease concentrations of rilpivirine (due to induction of CYP3A4) and absorption of tenofovir alafenamide (due to induction of intestinal P-gp). Therapeutic drug monitoring of rilpivirine is recommended. No effect on emtricitabine is expected.,(See Summary)
12,Rilpivirine/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (RPV/FTC/TAF),Agomelatine,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as agomelatin is metabolised predominantly by CYP1A2.

14,Rilpivirine/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (RPV/FTC/TAF),Albuvirtide,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Odefsey (rilpivirine, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide) is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and coadministration with other antiretroviral agents is not recommended in the Odefsey product labels. However, in specific clinical situations where an intensification of HIV treatment is needed, coadministration with albuvirtide would be possible from a pharmacokinetic standpoint. Rilpivirine is metabolized primarily by CYP3A with potential contribution from CYP2C19; tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine are eliminated renally. Albuvirtide is a peptide which is eliminated by catabolism to its constituent amino acids. In vitro human microsomal studies and limited in vivo drug-drug interaction data indicate that albuvirtide has no inhibiting or inducing properties on P450 enzymes. No interaction is expected with rilpivirine, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide.","Odefsey is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and should not be co-administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products.Odefsey Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, January 2019.Because Odefsey is a complete regimen, coadministration with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is not recommended.Odefsey US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, October 2018."
15,Rilpivirine/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (RPV/FTC/TAF),Alcohol,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Alcohol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase.

16,Rilpivirine/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (RPV/FTC/TAF),Alcuronium,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Alcuronium is predominantly eliminated unchanged via the kidneys. As there are no available data determining whether excretion is via active tubular secretion or glomerular filtration, there is some potential for competition with emtricitabine for active renal transport mechanisms, which may lead to increased levels of either drug. This mechanism of interaction is unlikely to be relevant for tenofovir alafenamide as this prodrug results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. Rilpivirine is unlikely to significantly inhibit alcuronium renal elimination. ",(See Summary)
17,Rilpivirine/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (RPV/FTC/TAF),Alendronic Acid,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"If taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product. ",(See Summary)

31,Rilpivirine/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (RPV/FTC/TAF),Amiodarone,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Amiodarone is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4; in vitro data suggest it is only a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. Rilpivirine, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are not expected to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Rilpivirine has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval at supra-therapeutic doses but these are unlikely to occur during coadministration with amiodarone. However, given the QT prolongation risk associated with amiodarone, caution is recommended. In addition, tenofovir alafenamide (the prodrug of tenofovir) is a substrate of P-gp and inhibitors of P-gp such as amiodarone are expected to increase the absorption of tenofovir alafenamide and thereby increase the systemic concentration. The recommended dose of 10 mg tenofovir alafenamide with P-gp inhibitors is not possible with Odefsey which is only available as a fixed dose combination containing 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide but it should be noted that tenofovir alafenamide has been associated with a large clinical safety profile.",(See Summary)
