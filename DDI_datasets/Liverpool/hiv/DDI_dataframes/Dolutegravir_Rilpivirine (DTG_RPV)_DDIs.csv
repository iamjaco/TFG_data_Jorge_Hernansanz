Artemisinins induce CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C19. Dolutegravir is not expected to inhibit or induce CYP or UGT enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations and a clinically significant effect of rilpivirine on artemisinin is unlikely. A clinically significant interaction with dolutegravir is not expected as CYP3A4 does not play a major role in dolutegravir metabolism.

Dolutegravir, an inhibitor of OCT2, could potentially decrease the efficacy of oxaliplatin. When possible, use raltegravir which does not inhibit OCT2. Rilpivirine does not interfere with this elimination pathway. Rilpivirine has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval at supra-therapeutic doses but these are unlikely to occur during coadministration with oxaliplatin.

Coadministration is expected to decrease both dolutegravir and rilpivirine exposures thus resulting in loss of virologic response. However, a recent study suggests a low risk of a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction with low-hyperforin formulations (<1 mg/day) of St John’s Wort (hyperforin is the constituent responsible for induction of CYPs and P-gp). Coadministration may be considered with St John’s Wort formulations that clearly state the hyperforin content and which have a total daily hyperforin dose of 1 mg or less.","Coadministration with St John’s wort is contraindicated. Co-administration may cause significant decreases in rilpivirine plasma concentrations. This may result in loss of therapeutic effect of Juluca. Coadministration with dolutegravir has not been studied but is expected to decrease dolutegravir concentrations. Decrease expected due to induction of UGT1A1 and CYP3A enzymes, a similar reduction in exposure as observed with carbamazepine is expected.

No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and P-glycoprotein, with AUC and Cmax of the probe drugs showing 90% confidence intervals well within the predefined bioequivalence range of 80-125% (GMR, drugs taken together with extract vs. probe drug alone). These data suggest that low hyperforin preparations of St John’s wort have a lower risk of drug-drug interactions than high hyperforin St. John’s wort preparations.No clinically relevant interactions of St. John's Wort extract Ze 117 low in hyperforin with cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein.

714,Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine (DTG/RPV),Valproate,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Valproate is mainly glucuronidated by UGTs 1A6, 1A9 and 2B7 and metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Valproate has no inducing effects on metabolism. Valproate has been shown to significantly reduce total dolutegravir concentrations due to protein binding displacement. However, this interaction is not clinically relevant since the concentrations of free dolutegravir (pharmacologically active) are not decreased. Rilpivirine at a dose of 25 mg once daily is unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of medicinal products metabolised by CYP or UGT enzymes.","Concentrations of total and free dolutegravir were determined to elucidate the mechanism of the previously observed drug-drug interaction between valproate and dolutegravir. The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) were assessed in 3 HIV infected individuals in presence and absence of valproate (Depakine enteric; 30 mg/kg, divided in two daily oral doses administered during 14 days). Samples for total and free dolutegravir Ctrough plasma concentration were taken on day 0 (prior to coadministration of valproate) and on day 1, 7, 14 (all with valproate), and finally on day 42 (without valproate). Subjects in study arms on dolutegravir without valproate served as controls. Total dolutegravir trough levels (mean ± SD) prior and after valproate 2.1 ± 1.4 mg/L on day 0 and 1.6 ± 0.67 mg/L on day 42. Of interest, coadministration of valproate decreased sharply total dolutegravir Ctrough on days 1, 7, and 14: 0.89 ± 0.57, 0.40 ± 0.30 and 0.28 ± 0.21 mg/L, respectively. Conversely, the free fraction of dolutegravir increased from 0.29-0.30% without valproate administration to 0.54-0.7% during valproate coadministration. Importantly, all free dolutegravir concentrations were above the proposed in vitro EC90 value of unbound dolutegravir (0.9 µg/L). This study demonstrates that the reported decreased in total dolutegravir concentrations with concomitant use of valproate is due to protein displacement. Since the free fraction (pharmacologically active) of dolutegravir is not reduced, this drug-drug interaction is unlikely to be of clinical relevance.The valproic acid - dolutegravir drug-drug interaction is based on displacement of protein binding and unlikely to be clinically relevant.

If ferrous fumarate cannot be taken at the same time as dolutegravir/rilpivirine, it should be taken well separated in time from the administration of dolutegravir/rilpivirine (minimum 6 hours before or 4 hours after).","The combination of Juluca and supplements should be used with particular caution. Iron supplements should be co-administered at the same time as Juluca, with a meal. If iron supplements cannot be taken at the same time as Juluca, these supplements should be taken well separated in time from the administration of Juluca (minimum 6 hours before or 4 hours after). Coadministration of iron supplements and dolutegravir decreased dolutegravir AUC, Cmax and C24 by 54%, 57% and 56%, respectively (complex binding to polyvalent ions).Juluca Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare Ltd, May 2018.Coadministration is expected to decrease dolutegravir concentrations. Administer Juluca and supplements containing iron together with a meal or take Juluca 4 hours before or 6 hours after taking these supplements. Coadministration of ferrous fumarate (324 mg) and dolutegravir (50 mg single dose) was studied when given simultaneously in fasted and fed conditions, and 2 h after dolutegravir. Simultaneous administration decreased dolutegravir Cmax, AUC and Ctrough by 57%, 54% and 56%, respectively, in fasted conditions (n=11). In fed conditions, simultaneous administration increased dolutegravir Cmax by 3%, decreased AUC by 2% and had no effect on Ctrough (n=11). Administration 2 h after dolutegravir decreased dolutegravir Cmax, AUC and Ctrough by 1%, 5% and 8%, respectively (n=10).Juluca US Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare Ltd, September 2018."
751,Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine (DTG/RPV),Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.,(See Summary)
752,Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine (DTG/RPV),Retinol (Vitamin A) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Vitamin A esters are hydrolysed by pancreatic enzymes to retinol, which is then absorbed and re-esterified. Some retinol is stored in the liver. Retinol not stored in the liver undergoes glucuronide conjugation and subsequent oxidation to retinal and retinoic acid.",(See Summary)
753,Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine (DTG/RPV),Phytomenadione (Vitamin K) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Metabolism of phytomenadione is thought to involve CYP4F2 and glucuronidation. Renal elimination of phytomenadione is minimal. As glucuronidation is not the sole route of elimination, there is little potential for an interaction with dolutegravir via competition for glucuronidation pathways. No interaction is expected with rilpivirine.",(See Summary)
754,Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine (DTG/RPV),Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Pyridoxine is absorbed from the GI tract and is converted to the active form pyridoxal phosphate. It is excreted in the urine as 4-pyridoxic acid.,(See Summary)
755,Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine (DTG/RPV),Iodine [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Iodine is converted to iodide, which is trapped in the thyroid gland. Iodides are excreted mainly in the urine with smaller amounts excreted in the faeces, sweat and saliva.",(See Summary)
756,Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine (DTG/RPV),Trastuzumab,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal IgG antibody. Elimination is similar to endogenous IgG and occurs primarily via proteolytic catabolism.,(See Summary)

760,Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine (DTG/RPV),Sevelamer,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Sevelamer is a resin not absorbed from the GI tract that may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. In the absence of data, when administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer. [Note: this interaction is not specific for dolutegravir and rilpivirine, but for any medication taken with sevelamer.]",(See Summary)
