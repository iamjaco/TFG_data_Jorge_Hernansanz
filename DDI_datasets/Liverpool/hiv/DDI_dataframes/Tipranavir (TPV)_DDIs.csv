0,Tipranavir (TPV),Abacavir (ABC),Do Not Coadminister,Moderate,Coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir decreased abacavir exposure by ~40%. The clinical relevance of the reduction in abacavir levels has not been established. Coadministration is not recommended unless there are no other available NRTIs suitable for patient management. In such cases no dosage adjustment of abacavir can be recommended.,"Abacavir has also been shown in vitro not to inhibit CYP 3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Induction of hepatic metabolism has not been observed in clinical studies. Therefore, there is little potential for interactions with antiretroviral PIs.Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, December 2018.Coadministration of abacavir (300 mg twice daily) and tipranavir/ritonavir (750/100 mg twice daily) decreased abacavir Cmax and AUC by 46% and 36%. The clinical relevance of this reduction has not been established, but may decrease the efficacy of abacavir. The concomitant use of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with abacavir is not recommended unless there are no other available NRTIs suitable for patient management. In such cases no dosage adjustment of abacavir can be recommended.Aptivus Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, December 2011.The pharmacokinetics of abacavir (300 mg bd) were studied in HIV+ subjects when coadministered with tipranavir/ritonavir (250/200 mg bd, n=28; 750/100 mg bd, n=14; 1250/100 bd, n=11). Abacavir Cmax and Cmin decreased by 44% with tipranavir/ritonavir 250/200 mg, decreased by 46% and 36% with tipranavir/ritonavir 750/100 mg and decreased by 52% and 35% with tipranavir/ritonavir 1250/100 mg. The clinical relevance of the ~40% reduction in abacavir levels not established. Dose adjustment of abacavir cannot be recommended at this time.Aptivus Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim, April 2012.The addition of tipranavir/ritonavir (1250/100 mg, n=11; 750/100 mg, n=14; 250/100 mg, n=28) was studied in HIV+ subjects on stable HAART regimens containing abacavir. Reductions in abacavir AUC were observed; however, the clinical significance of these findings is unclear.

1,Tipranavir (TPV),Acamprosate,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acamprosate is eliminated unchanged in the urine.,(See Summary)
2,Tipranavir (TPV),Acarbose,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. After ingestion of acarbose, the majority of active unchanged drug remains in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to exert its pharmacological activity and is metabolised by intestinal enzymes and by the microbial flora.",(See Summary)
3,Tipranavir (TPV),Acenocoumarol,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ritonavir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9. Tipranavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease acenocoumarol concentrations. Monitor INR.,(See Summary)
4,Tipranavir (TPV),Acetazolamide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acetazolamide is primarily excreted unchanged via the kidneys, there is therefore little potential for interaction with tipranavir via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.",(See Summary)
5,Tipranavir (TPV),Aciclovir (Acyclovir),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as aciclovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1.,(See Summary)
6,Tipranavir (TPV),Acitretin,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as acitretin undergoes isomerisation and glucuronidation.",(See Summary)
7,Tipranavir (TPV),Aclidinium bromide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aclidinium bromide is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed (non-enzymatic and enzymatic transformation by esterases and butylrylcholineesterases) to its pharmacologically inactive metabolites with only a minor role for CYP metabolism.,(See Summary)
8,Tipranavir (TPV),Adalimumab,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Adalimumab is a monoclonal IgG antibody. Elimination is similar to endogenous IgG and occurs primarily via proteolytic catabolism throughout the body.,(See Summary)
9,Tipranavir (TPV),Adefovir,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as adefovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1. ,(See Summary)
10,Tipranavir (TPV),Adrenaline (Epinephrine),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated, mostly in the liver by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). There is therefore little potential for interaction with tipranavir via modulation of, or competition for metabolic or elimination pathways.",(See Summary)
11,Tipranavir (TPV),African Potato,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolic data there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. African potato was shown to inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp in vitro and to activate PXR suggesting that inhibition may occur initially followed by induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp when used for extended periods. However, coadministration of African potato with lopinavir/ritonavir in healthy volunteers did not result in significant pharmacokinetic changes suggesting that boosting by ritonavir could offset the inducing effect of African potato. Similarly, no significant effect is expected on the pharmacokinetics of tipranavir.",(See Summary)
12,Tipranavir (TPV),Agomelatine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Agomelatine is metabolised predominantly by CYP1A2 which is induced by ritonavir. Coadministration with tipranavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease agomelatine exposure. Monitor clinical effect and increase dosage if needed. ,(See Summary)
13,Tipranavir (TPV),Albendazole,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 and the flavine-containing monooxygenase system are involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. Short term (2 doses) coadministration with ritonavir (200 mg) did not impact albendazole pharmacokinetics whereas long-term coadministration (8 days) decreased albendazole exposure likely due to ritonavir inducing effect. Tipranavir/ritonavir is unlikely to significantly affect albendazole exposure when used for a short duration treatment but may reduce the clinical effect of albendazole when used for a long duration treatment.,"In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400 mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and  its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

14,Tipranavir (TPV),Albuvirtide,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Albuvirtide is a peptide which is eliminated by catabolism to its constituent amino acids. Based on data from studies with lopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations of tipranavir/ritonavir may decrease but this is not expected to be clinically relevant. Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. However, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone (lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 37%, 33% and 35%, respectively; ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 38%, 39% and 28%, respectively). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 µg/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy. Furthermore, a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study) showed that albuvirtide + lopinavir/ritonavir was non-inferior to the standard second-line regimen lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine in HIV infected Chinese individuals suggesting that this interaction has no clinical consequences. In vitro human microsomal studies indicate that albuvirtide has no inducing properties on P450 enzymes. In addition, albuvirtide binds to <1% of serum albumin in the range of clinical concentrations, thus the observed decrease in lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations is unlikely to result from protein binding displacement. However, binding of the albuvirtide-albumin complex to the HIV protease inhibitor cannot be excluded.","Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 9 HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. Conversely, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone. The mean ratios (90% CI) of AUC, Cmax and Ctrough for lopinavir were 0.63 (0.49-0.82), 0.67 (053-0.86) and 0.65 (0.46-0.91). For ritonavir, AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 0.62 (0.42-0.91), 0.61 (0.38-0.99) and 0.72 (0.40-1.26). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 ug/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy.Evaluation of pharmacokinetic interactions between long-acting HIV-1 fusion inhibitor albuvirtide and lopinavir/ritonavir, in HIV-infected subjects, combined with clinical study and simulation results.

Xenobiotica. 2017, 47(2): 133-143.The safety and efficacy of albuvirtide plus lopinavir-ritonavir in antiretroviral-experienced Chinese adults with HIV-1 was assessed in a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study). Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive albuvirtide (once weekly) plus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (albuvirtide) or WHO-recommended second-line treatment (lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine; control). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma viral load <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Non-inferiority was pre-specified with a margin of 12%. Interim analysis of 48 week data from 46 subjects in the albuvirtide group and 50 patients in the control group showed 80.4% patients in the albuvirtide group had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL versus 66.0% in the control group (difference 14.4%, 95% CI -3.0% -31.9%), meeting the non-inferiority criteria.Efficacy and safety of long-acting HIV fusion inhibitor albuvirtide in antiretroviral-experienced adults with HIV-1: interim 48-week results from the randomized, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority TALENT study.

17,Tipranavir (TPV),Alendronic Acid,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"If taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product.",(See Summary)
18,Tipranavir (TPV),Alfentanil,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Alfentanil undergoes extensive CYP3A4 metabolism.

20,Tipranavir (TPV),Aliskiren,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Aliskiren is minimally metabolized by CYP450 however P-glycoprotein is a major determinant of aliskiren bioavailability. Tipranavir is an inducer of intestinal P-glycoprotein and therefore could potentially decrease the therapeutic effect. Monitor the antihypertensive response and adjust aliskiren dosage if needed.,(See Summary)
21,Tipranavir (TPV),Allopurinol,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as allopurinol is converted to oxipurinol by xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase. ,(See Summary)

In vitro data indicate that alosetron is metabolized by CYPs 2C9 (30%), 3A4 (18%) and 1A2 (10%); however, in vivo data suggest that CYP1A2 plays a more prominent role. In vitro data indicate that ritonavir induces CYP1A2, therefore coadministration with tipranavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease alosetron exposure.",(See Summary)
25,Tipranavir (TPV),Alprazolam,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Alprazolam is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4.

Enhanced levodopa effects including severe diskinesias were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Ciclesonide can be administered with tipranavir without dose adjustment, but with close monitoring. There is a risk of steroid side effects occurring, particularly if a high dose is used, or in case of prolonged administration, or if used with another medicine containing corticosteroids. These side effects are also more likely during periods of physiological stress. Ciclesonide is a pro-drug activated by esterases in the lungs to des-ciclesonide which then undergoes CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 7 days) with orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 µg once daily) did not alter ciclesonide but resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the AUC and a 2-fold increase in the Cmax of des-ciclesonide. Ciclesonide is mainly absorbed by the lungs, has a high protein binding and a high clearance resulting in a lower potential to cause systemic effects compared to some other inhaled corticosteroids.

Aptivus Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, December 2011.Coadministration of clarithromycin (500 mg bd, 25 doses) and tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg bd) to 24 subjects resulted in increases in tipranavir Cmax (40%), AUC (66%) and Cmin (100%), when compared to historical data (n=68). When the same doses were studied in 21 subjects, clarithromycin Cmax decreased by 5%, with AUC and Cmin increasing by 19% and 68% respectively. 14-OH-clarithromycin was markedly reduced (Cmax and AUC by 97%, Cmin by 95%). No dose adjustment of tipranavir or clarithromycin for patients with normal renal function is necessary. For patients with renal impairment the following dosage adjustments should be considered: for patients with CLCR 30-60 ml/min the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%; for patients with CLCR <30 ml/min the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 75%. Aptivus Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim, April 2012.Coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) and clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was studied in healthy volunteers. Coadministration increased clarithromycin AUC and Cmin by 19% and 68%, respectively; Cmax decreased by 5%. AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 14-OH clarithromycin decreased by >95%. When compared to historical data, tipranavir AUC and Cmax increased by 66% and 40% respectively; Cmin increased by 2-fold. Coadministration increases both tipranavir and clarithromycin exposure. For clarithromycin, this will not cause problems in patients with normal renal function, but patients using clarithromycin at doses higher than 500 mg twice daily should be carefully monitored for signs of toxicity.

149,Tipranavir (TPV),Clopidogrel,Do Not Coadminister,Low,"Coadministration of clopidogrel and boosted regimens has been evaluated in clinical studies. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite both by 69% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). In HIV-negative subjects (n=12), coadministration of clopidogrel and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 51% and 48%. Importantly, the decrease in clopidogrel’s active metabolite lead to insufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation in 44% of the patients treated with clopidogrel and ritonavir or cobicistat. Consistently, the study in HIV-negative subjects showed that the average inhibition of platelet aggregation was decreased from 51% (clopidogrel alone) to 31% (clopidogrel + ritonavir). Of interest, the study with HIV-infected patients showed a comparable decrease in prasugrel’s active metabolite AUC (52% decrease), however this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. The differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect is in line with clinical observations. Early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Taken together these data suggest that given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","Tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery or other medical conditions, or who are receiving medicinal products known to increase the risk of bleeding such as antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. Aptivus Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, December 2011. Aptivus Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim, April 2012.The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites.

Clin Pharmacokinet, 2018 [epub ahead of print].The impact of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel active metabolite (AM) and the pharmacodynamic effect was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Subjects ingested either placebo or clopidogrel (300 mg followed by 75 mg the two following days) alone and together with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Ritonavir significantly decreased the exposure of clopidogrel AM by 51% and average platelet inhibition significantly decreased from 51% without ritonavir to 31% with ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -27% to -12%). The maximal platelet inhibition by clopidogrel was also reduced from 60% to 40% during concurrent ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -29% to -11%). The authors conclude that patients receiving ritonavir are at risk for diminished clopidogrel response and consequently increased risk for atherothrombotic events if the two drugs are used concurrently.

Simultaneous administration did not significantly change dabigatran PK (possibly due to mixed induction and inhibition of P-gp by ritonavir as dabigatran is a substrate of P-gp). Administration 2 hours before ritonavir decreased dabigatran AUC by 29% and Cmax by 27% (n=16). These results suggests that dabigatran can be administered simultaneously with ritonavir when used once daily as a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with no renal impairment, though no data are available when ritonavir is used twice daily as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Data with verapamil (a P-gp inhibitor) and dabigatran suggest caution is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment as the dabigatran dose might need to be reduced in presence of a P-gp inhibitor such as tipranavir/ritonavir. Note, dabigatran is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment.","Coadministration of dabigatran (150 mg single dose) with ritonavir (100 mg, once daily, n=16) was studied in healthy volunteers in a cross-over study.

However, Ctrough was below the lower limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered at 110 mg twice daily 2 hours before verapamil but still within the therapeutic range in case of simultaneous administration. In individuals with mild renal impairment, predicted Ctrough exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered concurrently or 2 hours before verapamil at a dose of 150 mg twice daily but were within the therapeutic range when administered at a dose of 110 mg twice daily.

175,Tipranavir (TPV),Daunorubicin,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"A clinical study reported that ritonavir had no effect on daunorubicin (liposomal) pharmacokinetics. An in vitro study has shown that daunorubicin was able to inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A4, but was unlikely to cause clinically significant drug interactions via this mechanism. There is therefore little potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. Damage to the myocardium is one of the major risks of daunorubicin treatment and may include dose-independent supraventricular arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, AV-block) and/or non-specific ECG abnormalities. Ritonavir should be used with caution in patients taking medicines known to prolong the PR interval. Tipranavir/ritonavir may prolong the QT interval at supratherapeutic doses.","A study investigated the pharmacokinetics of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) administered alone or in combination with antiviral therapy including protease inhibitors (PI) to HIV-positive patients affected by Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXomeThe pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

","Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway.

Nevertheless, the clinical data available from the RESIST trials did not suggest any significant alteration of the tipranavir with ritonavir safety profile when combined with enfuvirtide as compared to patients treated with tipranavir with ritonavir without enfuvirtide.Aptivus Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, December 2011. At steady state, tipranavir trough concentrations were approximately 45% higher in patients co-administered enfuvirtide in the Phase 3 trials. The mechanism for this increase is not known. Dose adjustments are not recommended.Aptivus Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim, April 2012. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and concomitantly given medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. In an in vivo human metabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the metabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone). In separate pharmacokinetic interaction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in combination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP34A inducer) did not result in clinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide.Fuzeon Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2008.Results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that enfuvirtide is unlikely to have significant drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. No drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications have been identified that would warrant alteration of either the enfuvirtide dose or the dose of the other antiretroviral medication. Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 22%, 24% and 14% respectively. Coadministration of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC and Cmin of 14% and 26% respectively, with no change in Cmax. Fuzeon Prescribing Information, Roche Laboratories Inc, June 2007.Data from 55 HIV+ subjects who had multiple blood sampling followed by determination of tipranavir concentrations (27 with T20, Group A and 28 without T20, Group B) showed an unexpected interaction. Higher tipranavir concentrations (50% increase) were observed in the T20 group. Modelling of all the tipranavir data pointed to a higher apparent volume of distribution and elimination half-life in Group A. Of importance the authors also described 3 subjects where it was possible to assess the within subject effect and the data were consistent (i.e. an increase in TPV exposure on T20).Unexpected drug-drug interaction between tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/RTV) and enfuvirtide (T20).

Coadministration of fluconazole (100 mg once daily, 12 doses) and tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) to 20 subjects resulted in increases in tipranavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 32%, 50% and 69% when compared to historical data (n=68). There were no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole (decreases of 6%, 8% and 11% for Cmax, AUC and Cmin respectively).Aptivus Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim, April 2012.Coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) and fluconazole (200 mg loading dose, followed by 100 mg once daily) was studied in healthy volunteers. Coadministration had no significant effect on fluconazole AUC, Cmax and Cmin (decreases of 8%, 6% and 11%, respectively). When compared to historical data, tipranavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 50%, 32% and 69%, respectively. No dosage adjustment of fluconazole is required. Fluconazole appeared to have a significant effect on steady-state tipranavir, but the clinical significance of this increase in the exposure is not known. It has previously been shown that a 45.6% increase in tipranavir exposure does not result in increased toxicity; however, clinical monitoring of patients receiving this combination is advised. Interaction studies of tipranavir-ritonavir with clarithromycin, fluconazole and rifabutin in healthy volunteers. La Porte CJL, Sabo JP, Elgadi M, Cameron DW. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2009, 53(1): 162-173.The steady state pharmacokinetics of fluconazole (200 mg loading dose on day 1 then 100 mg once daily) were assessed alone, after a single dose of tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) and in combination with tipranavir/ritonavir at steady state. Following single dose tipranavir/ritonavir there was a 1, 3 and 2% reduction in fluconazole AUC, Cmax and C24h, respectively. Coadministration with tipranavir/ritonavir at steady state resulted in an 8, 6 and 11% in fluconazole AUC, Cmax and C24h, respectively. Fluconazole increased tipranavir AUC, Cmax and C12h by 56, 46 and 104%, respectively; compared to historical data (healthy volunteers taking tipranavir/ritonavir 500/200 mg twice daily at steady state). Coadministration of fluconazole and tipranavir/ritonavir (single dose and steady state) caused no clinically relevant changes in fluconazole plasma concentrations. However, since the C12h of tipranavir is increased by 104% by fluconazole, patients taking this combination should be carefully monitored.

292,Tipranavir (TPV),Fluphenazine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Fluphenazine is metabolised by CYP2D6. Tipranavir/ritonavir could potentially increase levels of fluphenazine via inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism, increasing likelihood of adverse events. Tipranavir/ritonavir at therapeutic doses did not prolong the QTc interval but may do so at supratherapeutic doses. The effect of fluphenazine on QT interval is likely to be potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval. The impact on the PR interval of coadministration with ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval has not been evaluated. Coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir and fluphenazine should be undertaken with caution. The European SPC for fluphenazine contraindicates the concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval.",(See Summary)

294,Tipranavir (TPV),Fluticasone,Do Not Coadminister,Moderate,"Concomitant use of tipranavir/ritonavir and glucocorticoids metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression. Systemic corticosteroid effects have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate. A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. beclometasone). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids progressive dose reduction may have to be performed over a longer period.","In a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules bid were co-administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82-89%). Greater effects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway eg budesonide.  It is unknown whether the combination of tipranavir with ritonavir might cause a larger increase in fluticasone exposure. Concomitant administration of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, and these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects. A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. beclomethasone).

Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Tipranavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS (via inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier).

346,Tipranavir (TPV),Ifosfamide,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of tipranavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as tipranavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.","The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites.

Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely.

In vitro data indicate that imatinib inhibits CYPs 3A4, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. The effect of tipranavir/ritonavir on imatinib exposure is difficult to predict as clinical studies with CYP3A4 inhibitors have yielded differing results. Ketoconazole increased imatinib exposure; however, ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) had no significant effect on imatinib exposure. Use with caution and monitor for imatinib related side effects. Imatinib may increase exposure of CYP3A4 substrates, such as tipranavir. ","Substances that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 activity (e.g. protease inhibitors such as indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, nelfinavir, boceprevir; ketoconazole, itraconazole; erythromycin, clarithromycin) could decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (the mean Cmax and AUC of imatinib rose by 26% and 40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when it was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be taken when administering imatinib with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolised drugs.Glivec Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, October 2012.There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (mean Cmax and AUC increased by 26% and 40% respectively) in healthy subjects when imatinib was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution is recommended when administering imatinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir). Substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Particular caution is recommended when administering imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window.Gleevec Prescribing Information, Novartis, January 2013.Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg). The dose of imatinib was decreased by 50% during coadministration with ritonavir (for safety reasons) and pharmacokinetic parameters were normalised to an imatinib dose of 400 mg. Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib.

Enhanced levodopa effects including severe diskinesias were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

557,Tipranavir (TPV),Prasugrel,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration of prasugrel with a pharmacoenhancer has been evaluated in a clinical study. Prasugrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of prasugrel’s active metabolite by 52% and 43% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). However this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. Conversely, this same study showed that ritonavir or cobicistat significantly reduced both clopidogrel’s active metabolite exposure and inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. These data are in line with clinical observations as early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of ritonavir or cobicistat boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites.

Since comparable efficacy was observed for this combination in phase 3 studies, dose adjustment is not recommended.Aptivus Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim, April 2012. An open label study was conducted in 18 healthy subjects who received raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) for 4 days (period 1), tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) for 7 days (period 2) and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) with tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) for 4 days (period 3). Raltegravir C12h was decreased by 55% when raltegravir was given with tipranavir/ritonavir, but AUC and Cmax were not significantly reduced. The authors concluded that although raltegravir C12h was decreased, favourable efficacy data in phase III studies indicate that tipranavir/ritonavir may be administered with raltegravir without dose adjustments.

596,Tipranavir (TPV),Retinol (Vitamin A) [in multivitamins],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely with retinol when given alone or in multivitamins. A clinical study demonstrated that ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir increased activity of retinal dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

599,Tipranavir (TPV),Rifabutin,Potential Interaction,Low,"Coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) and rifabutin (150 mg single dose) increased tipranavir Cmin by 16% but had no effect on Cmax or AUC. The AUC of rifabutin increased by ~3-fold and that of the metabolite increased by ~21-fold. Initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed that concentrations of rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) were significantly increased when combined with a boosted protease inhibitor, thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r and rifabutin (150 mg three times a week) resulted in rifabutin concentrations that were lower than those observed with rifabutin 300 mg once daily without protease inhibitors suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg  3 times a week and lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia).","Coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg QD) and tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg BID) increased rifabutin Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 70%, 190% and 114%.

661,Tipranavir (TPV),Tamoxifen,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYPs 3A4 and 2D6 may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen.

In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. Inhibition of CYP3A by tipranavir is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known. However, no effect of antiretroviral therapy on the response to vitamin D supplementation was found in a PK modelling study.","Pharmacokinetic modelling of vitamin D3 supplementation from 422 HIV-infected patients showed no significant differences in concentrations of 25-hydroxycolecalciferol related to antiretroviral drugs.Vitamin D3 supplementation scheme in HIV-infected patients based upon pharmacokinetic modelling of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol.

756,Tipranavir (TPV),Nicotinamide (Niacinamide) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Nicotinamide is metabolized by nicotinamide methyltransferase to N-methylnicotinamide which is then metabolized by xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase. Renal elimination of unchanged nicotinamide is minimal.,(See Summary)
757,Tipranavir (TPV),Tocopherol (Vitamin E) [alone],Potential Interaction,Very Low,Tipranavir/ritonavir should be used with caution in patients who taking supplemental vitamin E as these patients may be at risk of increased bleeding. Tipranavir oral solution has a higher vitamin E content than tipranavir capsules. The European product labels advise not to coadminister more than 1200 IU of vitamin E per day with tipranavir capsules and that patients taking tipranavir oral solution should not take any supplemental vitamin E. The US product label for tipranavir advises not to take tipranavir oral solution with supplemental vitamin E greater than a standard multivitamin as tipranavir oral solution contains 116 IU/mL of vitamin E which is higher than the Reference Daily Intake.,"Tipranavir capsules, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, should be used with caution in patients who are receiving medicinal products known to increase the risk of bleeding such as antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants or who are taking supplemental vitamin E. Based on the limits of exposure available from observation in clinical trials, it is recommended not to co-administer to patients more than 1,200 IU vitamin E per day.Aptivus (soft capsules) Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim Ltd, August 2018.Tipranavir oral solution, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, should be used with caution in patients are receiving medicinal products known to increase the risk of bleeding such as antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants or who are taking supplemental vitamin E.

758,Tipranavir (TPV),Iodine [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Iodine is converted to iodide, which is trapped in the thyroid gland. Iodides are excreted mainly in the urine with smaller amounts excreted in the faeces, sweat and saliva. ",(See Summary)
759,Tipranavir (TPV),Retinol (Vitamin A) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. A clinical study demonstrated that ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir increased the activity of retinal dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.
