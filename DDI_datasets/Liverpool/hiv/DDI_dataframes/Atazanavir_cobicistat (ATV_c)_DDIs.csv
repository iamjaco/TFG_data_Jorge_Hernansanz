0,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Abacavir (ABC),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration with atazanavir/cobicistat has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Coadministration of abacavir (600 mg once daily) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) had no effect on atazanavir or ritonavir pharmacokinetics, but decreased abacavir AUC (17%) and Cmax (20%). These changes are unlikely to be clinically significant.","Abacavir has also been shown in vitro not to inhibit CYP 3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Induction of hepatic metabolism has not been observed in clinical studies. Therefore, there is little potential for interactions with antiretroviral PIs.Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, December 2018.Coadministration of abacavir (600 mg, once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg, once daily) was studied in 12 HIV+ subjects.

11,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),African Potato,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. African potato was shown to inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp in vitro and to activate PXR suggesting that inhibition may occur initially followed by induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp when used for extended periods. However, coadministration of African potato with lopinavir/ritonavir in healthy volunteers did not result in significant pharmacokinetic changes suggesting that boosting by ritonavir could offset the inducing effect of African potato. Similarly, no significant effect is expected with atazanavir/cobicistat.",(See Summary)
12,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Agomelatine,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as agomelatine is metabolised predominantly via CYP1A2. Atazanavir/cobicistat does not inhibit or induce CYP1A2 at clinically relevant concentrations.",(See Summary)
13,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Albendazole,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 and the flavine-containing monooxygenase system are involved in the formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. Short term (2 doses) coadministration with ritonavir (200 mg) did not impact albendazole pharmacokinetics whereas long-term coadministration (8 days) decreased albendazole exposure likely due to ritonavir inducing effect. Cobicistat has no inducing effect and therefore atazanavir/cobicistat is not expected to significantly impact albendazole when administered long-term.,"In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400 mg albendazole, in the absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir.Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

14,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Albuvirtide,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Albuvirtide is a peptide which is eliminated by catabolism to its constituent amino acids. Based on data from studies with lopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations of atazanavir/cobicistat may decrease but this is not expected to be clinically relevant. Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. However, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone (lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 37%, 33% and 35%, respectively; ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 38%, 39% and 28%, respectively). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 Âµg/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy. Furthermore, a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study) showed that albuvirtide + lopinavir/ritonavir was non-inferior to the standard second-line regimen lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine in HIV infected Chinese individuals suggesting that this interaction has no clinical consequences. In vitro human microsomal studies indicate that albuvirtide has no inducing properties on P450 enzymes. In addition, albuvirtide binds to <1% of serum albumin in the range of clinical concentrations, thus the observed decrease in lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations is unlikely to result from protein binding displacement. However, binding of the albuvirtide-albumin complex to the HIV protease inhibitor cannot be excluded.","Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 9 HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. Conversely, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone. The mean ratios (90% CI) of AUC, Cmax and Ctrough for lopinavir were 0.63 (0.49-0.82), 0.67 (053-0.86) and 0.65 (0.46-0.91). For ritonavir, AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 0.62 (0.42-0.91), 0.61 (0.38-0.99) and 0.72 (0.40-1.26). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 ug/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy.Evaluation of pharmacokinetic interactions between long-acting HIV-1 fusion inhibitor albuvirtide and lopinavir/ritonavir, in HIV-infected subjects, combined with clinical study and simulation results.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma viral load <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Non-inferiority was pre-specified with a margin of 12%. Interim analysis of 48 week data from 46 subjects in the albuvirtide group and 50 patients in the control group showed 80.4% patients in the albuvirtide group had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL versus 66.0% in the control group (difference 14.4%, 95% CI -3.0% -31.9%), meeting the non-inferiority criteria.Efficacy and safety of long-acting HIV fusion inhibitor albuvirtide in antiretroviral-experienced adults with HIV-1: interim 48-week results from the randomized, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority TALENT study.

In vitro data indicate that beclometasone is a pro-drug which is hydrolysed via esterase enzymes to the highly active metabolite beclometasone-17-monopropionate. This active metabolite is subsequently converted to inactive metabolites via CYP3A4/5. Coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (160 mg twice daily) increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate by 108% and 67%, respectively. However, coadministration of a boosted PI (darunavir/ritonavir, 600/100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. Although statistically significant, the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir is unlikely to be of clinical significance as no significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir.

Her ART included tenofovir (300 mg once daily), emtricitabine (200 mg once daily), and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily). Because of previous bilateral cytomegalovirus retinitis, complicated by immune recovery uveitis with severe, chronic, cystoid macular oedema, she was also using dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops six times daily, and betamethasone 0.1% eye ointment at night, in both eyes. On examination, she was noted to have central adiposity and enlargement of the dorsocervical fat, but no peripheral lipoatrophy. An MRI scan of the hip showed avascular necrosis. A tetracosactide (Synacthen) stimulation test showed marked suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis, with a baseline cortisol of less than 25 nmol/L rising to only 37 nmol/l 30 min after administration of tetracosactide 250mg (normal response at 30 min, >570 nmol/L). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was undetectable. The presence of adrenal axis suppression with low ACTH, in the context of Cushingoid features and avascular necrosis of the hip, suggested ongoing exposure to high systemic levels of exogenous corticosteroids. Ritonavir and atazanavir were substituted with efavirenz (600 mg once daily) while continuing the steroid eye drops. Oral hydrocortisone 15 mg daily was added to avoid precipitating crisis due to adrenal insufficiency. Over the following year, the patientâs weight declined, with marked improvement in her adrenal function. Analysis of stored serum samples revealed elevated levels of dexamethasone at presentation (1.4-1.7 nmol/L) which fell dramatically after discontinuation of protease inhibitor therapy (undetectable to 0.181 nmol/L). Although prior courses of oral and intravenous corticosteroids may have contributed to adrenal axis suppression, the close temporal correlation between discontinuation of ritonavir, reversal of weight gain and recovery of adrenal function, combined with detectable levels of dexamethasone in the blood, strongly suggests that co-administration of ritonavir was responsible for the accumulation of excessive systemic levels of topical ocular corticosteroids, resulting in adrenal axis suppression and Cushingâs syndrome.Cushingâs syndrome and adrenal axis suppression in a patient treated with ritonavir and corticosteroid eye drops.

Amlodipine, hydralazine, and furosemide were added to control the hypertension and edema, but budesonide was discontinued after 3 weeks because of persistent severe edema that was refractory to furosemide. The patient developed edema, weight gain, uncontrolled hypertension,Â  Cushingoid facies, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis shortly after initiation of budenoside, with resolution of all symptoms soon after it was stopped.Â  Congestive heart failure, liver disease, and nephrotic syndrome were ruled out as causes of the edema, which supported the diagnosis of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome. Although budesonide concentrations were not measured, the very low serum cortisol level (0.8 Âµg/dL) in a clinical setting of hypercortisolism provides strong indirect evidence that levels of an exogenous corticosteroid (i.e., budesonide) were high.Cushingâs syndrome due to antiretroviral-budesonide interaction.

Enhanced levodopa effects including severe dyskinesia were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir/cobicistat.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsons's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsonâs had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in the daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

There is a risk of steroid side effects occurring, particularly if a high dose is used, or in case of prolonged administration, or if used with another medicine containing corticosteroids. These side effects are also more likely during periods of physiological stress. Ciclesonide is a pro-drug activated by esterases in the lungs to des-ciclesonide which then undergoes CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 7 days) with orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 Âµg once daily) did not alter ciclesonide but resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the AUC and a 2-fold increase in the Cmax of des-ciclesonide. Ciclesonide is mainly absorbed by the lungs, has a high protein binding and a high clearance resulting in a lower potential to cause systemic effects compared to some other inhaled corticosteroids.

146,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Clopidogrel,Do Not Coadminister,Low,"Coadministration of clopidogrel and boosted regimens has been evaluated in clinical studies. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrelâs active metabolite both by 69% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). In HIV-negative subjects (n=12), coadministration of clopidogrel and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrelâs active metabolite by 51% and 48%. Importantly, the decrease in clopidogrelâs active metabolite lead to insufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation in 44% of the patients treated with clopidogrel and ritonavir or cobicistat. Consistently, the study in HIV-negative subjects showed that the average inhibition of platelet aggregation was decreased from 51% (clopidogrel alone) to 31% (clopidogrel + ritonavir). Of interest, the study with HIV-infected patients showed a comparable decrease in prasugrelâs active metabolite AUC (52% decrease), however this decrease did not impair prasugrelâs antiplatelet effect. The differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect is in line with clinical observations. Early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Taken together these data suggest that given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites.

Subjects ingested either placebo or clopidogrel (300 mg followed by 75 mg the two following days) alone and together with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Ritonavir significantly decreased the exposure of clopidogrel AM by 51% and average platelet inhibition significantly decreased from 51% without ritonavir to 31% with ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -27% to -12%). The maximal platelet inhibition by clopidogrel was also reduced from 60% to 40% during concurrent ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -29% to -11%). The authors conclude that patients receiving ritonavir are at risk for diminished clopidogrel response and consequently increased risk for atherothrombotic events if the two drugs are used concurrently.

Coadministration with atazanavir/cobicistat may increase concentrations of docetaxel and increase the risk of severe toxicities. There have been several case reports of severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity when coadministered with potent CYP3A inhibitors.

Each patient recovered following the withdrawal of docetaxel.Â Severe toxicity related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. Mir O, Dessard-Diana B, Louet AL, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2010, 69(1): 99-101.A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours. One cohort of patients (n=4) received 10 mg of oral docetaxel and a subsequent cohort (n=8) 100 mg of oral docetaxel, coadministered with 100 mg oral ritonavir randomized to simultaneous administration or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel on days 1 and 8. On day 15 or 22, patients received 100 mg i.v. docetaxel. Docetaxel AUC in patients who received 10 mg oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was low, and the dose could safely be increased to 100 mg. The AUC in patients who received 100 mg oral docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was 2.4 Â± 1.5 and 2.8 Â± 1.4 mg/L.h, respectively, compared with 1.9 Â± 0.4 mg/L.h after i.v. docetaxel. The apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was >100% (i.e. 131 Â± 90% and 161 Â± 91%, respectively), indicating marked inhibition by ritonavir of gut wall and/or hepatic metabolism. Coadministration of ritonavir significantly enhanced the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel and caution is essential when giving docetaxel with boosted PIs.Â Coadministration of ritonavir strongly enhances the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel in patients with solid tumors.

Enhanced levodopa effects including severe dyskinesia were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir/cobicistat.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsons's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsonâs had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

However this decrease did not impair prasugrelâs antiplatelet effect. This same study showed that clopidogrel effect was altered by either cobicistat and ritonavir therefore prasugrel should be preferred in presence of cobicistat-boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects.

However, in specific clinical situations where an intensification of HIV treatment is needed, coadministration with atazanavir/cobicistat would be possible from a pharmacokinetic standpoint. Atazanavir/cobicistat may increase rilpivirine concentrations however this is not considered to be clinically relevant. Rilpivirine has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval at supra-therapeutic doses but equivalent rilpivirine concentrations are unlikely to occur during coadministration with atazanavir/cobicistat. However, the product labels for Odefsey indicate that rilpivirine should be used with caution in combination with drugs with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. Tenofovir alafenamide is dosed 25 mg in Odefsey whereas the recommended dose of tenofovir alafenamide is 10 mg with P-gp inhibitors such as atazanavir/cobicistat.

637,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Sorafenib,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Sorafenib is metabolized to a moderate extent by CYP3A4 and UGT1A9, UGT1A1. Coadministration of sorafenib and ritonavir in patients with Kaposi sarcoma did not significantly alter the exposure of sorafenib, however, a decrease in sorafenib-N-oxide (CYP3A4 mediated metabolite) was noted. The study had to be terminated early due to poor tolerance, which could possibly be related to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir leading to the formation of more toxic metabolites. A similar effect is expected with cobicistat. Use with caution if coadministered due to poor tolerability. In addition, both atazanavir and sorafenib have been shown to prolong the QT/QTc interval.","Coadministration of sorafenib with ritonavir was studied in patients with Kaposi sarcoma in a parallel study. One cohort consisted of patients receiving ritonavir (n=8), and the other of patients not receiving ritonavir (n=2). Those on ritonavir received 200 mg of sorafenib once daily, and those not on ritonavir, 200 mg sorafenib twice daily. Sorafenib AUC was unaffected by ritonavir coadministration, but a decreasing trend in sorafenib-N-oxide (CYP3A4 metabolite) AUC was noted. Sorafenib was poorly tolerated, and the study terminated early. The authors suggest that ritonavir may contribute to sorafenib toxicity by inhibition of CYP3A4, shunting of metabolism towards other pathways yielding more toxic metabolites that could possibly explain the toxicity observed.

Coadministration with voriconazole is not recommended unless the benefit/risk assessment justifies the use of voriconazole.Evotaz US Prescribing Information Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2018.Voriconazole is mainly metabolized by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Due to genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19, voriconazole AUC is on average 2-4 fold higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers (PM) than in extensive metabolisers (EM). In a majority CYP2C19 EM population, low dose ritonavir decreased voriconazole AUC by ~40%, likely due to induction of CYP2C19 by ritonavir. This study assessed the two-way drug interactions when adding voriconazole to atazanavir/ritonavir in both CYP2C19 EM and PM healthy subjects. Voriconazole was administered alone on days 1-3, atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100mg once daily) administered alone on days 11-20, and the drugs coadministered on days 21-30. The voriconazole doses were 200 mg twice daily (400 mg twice daily on days 1 and 21) for EM subjects and 50 mg twice daily (100 mg twice daily on days 1 and 21) for PM subjects. 20 EM and 7 PM subjects completed the study. In EM subjects, coadministration decreased voriconazole AUC and Cmin by 33% and 39%, respectively; atazanavir AUC and Cmin decreased 12% and 20%, respectively. In PM subjects, coadministration increased voriconazole Cmax and AUC by 4-4 fold and 5.6-fold, respectively; atazanavir AUC and Cmin decreased by 20% and 31%, respectively. Ritonavir Cmax and AUC were generally unchanged in either population. The decrease in voriconazole AUC seen in EM subjects, (33%) is similar to the historical observation of 39% when voriconazole was given with low dose ritonavir. In PM subjects, coadministration markedly increased voriconazole exposure, likely through inhibition of CYP3A4.

However, use with caution due to the risk of QT interval prolongation reported for both drugs.",(See Summary)
729,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Vortioxetine,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Vortioxetine is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5. Atazanavir/cobicistat is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 and therefore is expected to increase vortioxetine to a limited extent. No a priori dosage adjustment is needed. However, based on the patient clinical response, a lower dose of vortioxetine may be needed in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers in presence of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor such as atazanavir/cobicistat.Â ",(See Summary)
730,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Warfarin,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Warfarin is a mixture of enantiomers which are metabolised by different cytochromes. R-warfarin is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. S-warfarin (more potent) is metabolised by CYP2C9. Atazanavir/cobicistat could potentially increase R-warfarin concentrations (inhibition of CYP3A4). Monitor INR during coadministration and for the first weeks after stopping atazanavir/cobicistat.,"Co-administration with Evotaz has the potential to produce serious and/or life-threatening bleeding due to increased exposure to warfarin and has not been studied. It is recommended that the INR (International Normalized Ratio) be monitored. The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and cobicistat.Evotaz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, November 2018.The effect of coadministration on warfarin concentrations is unknown.

734,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Zidovudine (AZT/ZDV),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration with atazanavir/cobicistat has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Coadministration with atazanavir alone had no significant effect on zidovudine concentrations and cobicistat is not expected to have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine.,"Coadministration of lamivudine/zidovudine (150/300 mg twice daily) and atazanavir (400 mg once daily) was studied. No significant effect on lamivudine and zidovudine concentrations was observed when coadministered with atazanavir. Based on these data and because cobicistat is not expected to have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine, the coadministration of Evotaz with zidovudine is not expected to significantly alter the exposure of zidovudine.Evotaz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, November 2018.Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) and zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) was studied in 19 subjects. There were negligible increases in the Cmax, AUC and Cmin of lamivudine (4%, 3% and 12%, respectively).

735,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Ziprasidone,Do Not Coadminister,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. The US Prescribing information for ziprasidone contraindicates its use in the presence of other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Coadministration is not recommended due to the potential of life threatening arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death. Approximately two thirds of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is by reduction, with less than one third by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4). Coadministration could potentially increase ziprasidone concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4.",(See Summary)

Zonisamide is metabolized partly by CYP3A4 and also by N-acetyl-transferases and conjugation. Atazanavir/cobicistat could potentially increase zonisamide concentrations. However since coadministration of zonisamide and ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) had no effect on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of zonisamide given to healthy subjects, this interaction is unlikely to be clinically significant.",(See Summary)
739,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Zopiclone,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Zopiclone is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8.

740,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Zotepine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Zotepine is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, and can prolong the QT interval. Coadministration may increase zotepine concentrations and thereby increase the risk of QT interval. Caution should be exercised when administering both drugs due to the risk of QT prolongation. Monitor for side effects and reduce zotepine dosage as needed.",(See Summary)
741,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Zuclopenthixol,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied.

744,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. Inhibition of CYP3A by atazanavir/cobicistat is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known. However, no effect of antiretroviral therapy on the response to vitamin D supplementation was found in a PK modelling study.","Pharmacokinetic modelling of vitamin D3 supplementation from 422 HIV-infected patients showed no significant differences in concentrations of 25-hydroxycolecalciferol related to antiretroviral drugs.Vitamin D3 supplementation scheme in HIV-infected patients based upon pharmacokinetic modelling of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol.

745,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Trastuzumab emtansine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but is not recommended. Trastuzumab emtansine is a monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate. Trastuzumab does not undergo CYP mediated metabolism, however, DM1 (an active component of emtansine) is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration is not recommended due to the potential for an increase in DM1 exposure and toxicity. Consider switching to an antiretroviral regimen with no inhibitory effects on CYP3A4. If coadministration is unavoidable, consider delaying trastuzumab emtansine treatment until the antiretroviral drug is cleared from the circulation (approximately 4 elimination half-lives), if possible. If trastuzumab emtansine cannot be delayed, monitor closely for toxicity.",(See Summary)

747,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Ascorbic acid is oxidised to dehydroascorbic acid where some is metabolised to oxalic acid and the inactive ascorbate-2-sulphate. Large doses are rapidly excreted in the urine when in excess of the requirements of the body. Atazanavir/cobicistat does not interfere with this metabolic pathway.,(See Summary)
748,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Nicotinamide (Niacinamide) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

754,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Eletriptan,Do Not Coadminister,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Eletriptan is metabolised by CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by atazanavir/cobicistat. Coadministration with ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased eletriptan Cmax and AUC by 2.7 and 5.9 fold, respectively. The US product label for eletriptan contraindicates its use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors whereas the European product label advises that it should not be used with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.",(See Summary)

756,Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Retinol (Vitamin A) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. A clinical study demonstrated that ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir increased the activity of retinal dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.
