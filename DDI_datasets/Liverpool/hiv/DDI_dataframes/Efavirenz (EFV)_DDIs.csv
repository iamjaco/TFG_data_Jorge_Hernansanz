13,Efavirenz (EFV),Albendazole,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. When antiepileptics (phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) were coadministered with albendazole, significantly reduced levels of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide were observed, apparently due to induction of CYP3A4. Similarly, coadministration with efavirenz could reduce albendazole exposure; however, the clinical relevance is unknown as the antihelmintic action is thought to be mainly intra-intestinal.","Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital appear to induce the oxidative metabolism of albendazole via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A by roughly the same extent, resulting in significantly reduced concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide. This interaction is likely to be clinically significant when albendazole is used to treat systemic worm infections, and increased doses of albendazole would be needed.

345,Efavirenz (EFV),Ifosfamide,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of efavirenz via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Pretreatment with the CYP3A inducer dexamethasone proportionally decreased the AUC for both ifosfamide metabolites. induction of CYP2B enzymes by high-dose phenobarbital pretreatment significantly decreased the fraction of ifosfamide undergoing 4-hydroxylation from 37% to 22% of total metabolism. As efavirenz is an enzyme inducer, there is potential for ifosfamide levels to be reduced if coadministered.","The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites.

In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies. Hamberg P, Steeghs N, Loos WJ et al. Br J Cancer. 2010 Jun 8;102(12):1699-706.In an animal study in which rats were treated with ifosfamide alone or in conjunction with various P450 inducers and inhibitors, induction of liver P450 2B enzymes by 4-day high-dose phenobarbital (PB) pretreatment significantly decreased the fraction of IF undergoing 4-hydroxylation  from 37% to 22% of total metabolism. Pretreatment with the P450 3A inducer dexamethasone proportionally decreased the AUC for both IF metabolites, without any net impact on the fraction of IF undergoing metabolic activation. These findings demonstrate specific roles for P450 2B and 3A enzymes in catalysing these pathways of IF metabolism in vivo. These studies also highlight several clinically relevant drug interactions that may occur during concomitant administration of IF with drugs and other compounds that modulate hepatic P450 enzyme levels.Modulation of P450-dependent ifosfamide pharmacokinetics: a better understanding of drug activation in vivo.

348,Efavirenz (EFV),Imatinib,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Imatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 1A2, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. In vitro data indicate that imatinib inhibits CYPs 3A4, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. Efavirenz could potentially decrease imatinib exposure (induction of CYP3A4), potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. The US Prescribing Information suggests considering alternative therapeutic agents with less enzyme induction potential when CYP3A4 inducers are indicated. Imatinib may increase exposure of CYP3A4 substrates, such as efavirenz.","Substances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity may significantly reduce exposure to imatinib, potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. Pre-treatment with multiple doses of rifampicin 600 mg followed by a single 400 mg dose of imatinib resulted in decrease in Cmax and AUC by at least 54% and 74%, of the respective values without rifampicin treatment. Similar results were observed in patients with malignant gliomas treated with imatinib while taking enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) such as carbazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin. The plasma AUC for imatinib decreased by 73% compared to patients not on EIAEDs. Concomitant use of rifampicin or other strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be avoided. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolised drugs.Glivec Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, October 2012.Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with multiple doses of rifampin followed by a single dose of imatinib, increased imatinib oral-dose clearance by 3.8-fold, which significantly (p<0.05) decreased mean Cmax and AUC. Similar findings were observed in patients receiving 400-1200 mg/day imatinib concomitantly with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED) (e.g., carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone). The mean dose normalized AUC for imatinib in the patients receiving EIAED’s decreased by 73% compared to patients not receiving EIAED. Concomitant administration of imatinib and St. John’s Wort led to a 30% reduction in the AUC of imatinib. Consider alternative therapeutic agents with less enzyme induction potential in patients when rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers are indicated. Imatinib doses up to 1200 mg/day (600 mg BID) have been given to patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Particular caution is recommended when administering imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window.Gleevec Prescribing Information, Novartis, January 2013."

353,Efavirenz (EFV),Indinavir (IDV),Potential Interaction,Moderate,"Coadministration of efavirenz with indinavir alone decreases indinavir concentrations; increasing indinavir to 1000 mg three times daily did not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz. Coadministration with indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 twice daily) had no effect on efavirenz AUC or Cmin, but decreased the AUC and Cmin of indinavir and ritonavir. No specific dose recommendation can be given for indinavir alone. Dose increases of indinavir/ritonavir when given in combination with efavirenz have not been studied. ","When indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) was given with efavirenz (200 mg every 24 hours), indinavir AUC and Cmin were decreased by 31% and 40% respectively. A similar reduction in indinavir exposures was observed when indinavir 1000 mg every 8 hours was given with efavirenz 600 mg daily. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed for efavirenz. While the clinical significance of decreased indinavir concentrations has not been established, the magnitude of the observed pharmacokinetic interaction should be taken into consideration when choosing a regimen containing both efavirenz and indinavir. No adjustment of the dose of efavirenz is necessary when given with indinavir. When efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was given with indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily), indinavir AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were decreased by approximately 25%, 50% and 17%, respectively, compared to indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg twice daily given without efavirenz. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed for efavirenz. The geometric mean Cmin for indinavir (0.33 mg/L) when given with ritonavir and efavirenz was higher than the mean historical Cmin (0.15 mg/L) when indinavir was given alone at 800 mg every 8 hours. In HIV-1 infected patients (n=6), the pharmacokinetics of indinavir and efavirenz were generally comparable to these uninfected volunteer data. No adjustment of the dose of efavirenz is necessary when given with indinavir/ritonavir. Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.Coadministration of indinavir (1000 mg every 8 hours) and efavirenz (600 mg), was studied in 20 subjects. When compared to values obtained with indinavir alone (800 mg every 8 hours), no alteration in indinavir Cmax was observed after the morning or afternoon dose, whereas a 29% reduction was observed following the evening dose. Indinavir AUC was reduced by 33%, 37% and 46% and Cmin was reduced by 39%, 52% and 57% following morning, afternoon and evening doses, respectively. No alterations in efavirenz Cmax, AUC or Cmin were observed when efavirenz (200 mg once daily for 14 days) was given with indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours for 14 days) to 11 subjects. The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with efavirenz is not known. Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz. When indinavir at an increased dose (1000 mg every 8 hours) was given with efavirenz (600 mg once daily), the indinavir AUC and Cmin were decreased on average by 33-46% and 39-57%, respectively, compared to when indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) was given alone.Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.An increased dose (1000 mg three times daily) of indinavir does not compensate for the inducing effect of efavirenz. When compared to indinavir (800 mg three times daily), coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and indinavir (1000 mg three time daily) decreased indinavir AUC by 46% and Cmin by 57%. Coadministration of a lower dose of efavirenz (200 mg once daily) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily) decreased indinavir AUC by 31% and Cmin by 40%; efavirenz AUC was unchanged. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 twice daily) had no effect on efavirenz AUC or Cmin. Indinavir AUC and Cmin decreased by 25% and 50%; ritonavir AUC and Cmin decreased by 36% and 39%. No specific dose recommendation can be given for indinavir alone. Dose increases of indinavir/ritonavir when given in combination with efavirenz have not been studied. Crixivan Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, February 2012.Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 10 days) and indinavir (1000 mg three time daily for 10 days) to 20 HIV+ subjects resulted in no change in indinavir Cmax for the morning and afternoon doses and a 29% decrease for the evening dose. Indinavir AUC decreased by 33-37% for the morning and afternoon doses, and by 46% for the evening dose. Indinavir Cmin decrease by 39%, 52% and 57% for the morning, afternoon and evening doses respectively. There were no significant changes in efavirenz Cmax or AUC. The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with efavirenz, is not known. Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz. Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, April 2012.Adequate indinavir concentrations were described in 29-year old HIV+ Thai male receiving indinavir/ritonavir with efavirenz and rifampicin. Prior to the introduction of rifampicin-based TB therapy, the patient had been receiving indinavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). Indinavir trough and peakl plasma concentrations were 1.73 mg/L and 11.21 mg/L, respectively; efavirenz concentration determined mid-dose was 1.06 mg/L. Following the introduction of rifampicin, indinavir/ritonavir was maintained at 600/100 mg, giving indinavir trough and peak concentrations of 0.26 and 4.66 mg/L, respectively. Efavirenz was increased to 800 mg once daily, giving a mid-dose efavirenz concentration of 4.69 mg/L. After completion of TB therapy, the efavirenz dose was reduced to 600 mg. Although indinavir concentrations were significantly reduced, they were still compatible with clinical efficacy, as well as improved tolerability and safety. The reduction in indinavir concentrations was associated with improved renal function and the increased efavirenz dose was well tolerated. Indinavir has generally not been combined with rifampicin because of significant reductions in indinavir concentrations. However, it may be possible, especially with low body weight, to use indinavir at the usual dose (800/100 mg twice daily) in the presence of rifampicin and achieve a satisfactory therapeutic effect despite enzymic induction.Maintenance of successful ritonavir-boosted indinavir and efavirenz therapy in an HIV-infected patient with tuberculosis. Boyd MA, Burger DM, Phanuphak P, Cooper DA. AIDS, 2006, 20(7): 1083-1085.The effect of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir/ritonavir (400/400 mg twice daily) was studied in 8 HIV+ subjects. Neither indinavir nor RTV parameters were significantly changed in the presence of efavirenz. Indinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin were 2.9 vs 2.6 mg/L, 17.6 vs 16.2 mg/L.h, and 0.5 vs 0.4 mg/L, alone vs combination respectively. Ritonavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin were 6.6 vs 5.0 mg/L, 42.8 vs 37.7 mg/L.h, and 1.7 vs 1.7 mg/L, alone vs combination respectively.

King, J et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 33.A pharmacokinetic study was performed in 6 HIV patients receiving indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). The geometric mean indinavir Cmin was 0.32 mg/L (95% CI 0.13-0.82) and was lower than had been previously reported for indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) without efavirenz. Cmin values were above the target of 0.15 mg/L in 5/6 patients. The geometric mean Cmin for efavirenz at 24 h was 2.7 mg/L (95% CI 1.3-5.7) and was higher than described in product literature (1.8 mg/L). Efavirenz Cmin was above the minimum target value of 1.0 mg/L in all 6 subjects; 2 subjects had concentrations above the upper target of 4.0 mg/L.

Coadministration of indinavir (400, 600 or 800 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was studied in 6 HIV+ subjects, 5 of whom were also taking efavirenz. Evening indinavir trough concentrations were 141 ng/ml (400 mg), 248 ng/ml (600 mg) and 474 ng/ml (800 mg); evening trough concentrations were 56% lower than morning trough concentrations. Evening troughs were above an efficacy threshold of 150 ng/ml in all subjects on 800 mg, but were below target in one subject on 600 mg and four subjects on 400 mg.

The twice daily indinavir regimen tended toward a higher Cmax and lower Cmin compared to those for indinavir 1000 mg three times daily. The median Cmin obtained with the twice daily regimen was 54 ng/ml and was inadequate based on a target range of 80-120 ng/ml.

The steady state pharmacokinetics of indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) were evaluated in 20 HIV+ Thai subjects. Indinavir geometric mean (with 95% CI) AUC, Cmin and Cmax were 45.7 (39.8-52.5) mg/L.h, 0.32 ( 0.24-0.44) mg/L and 11.1 (9.4-13.0) mg/L respectively. A >10-fold variation in Cmin was observed, but all were at least comparable to those obtained following indinavir 800 mg three times daily alone. Efavirenz geometric mean Cmin at 24 h was 2.1 mg/L (95% CI 1.6-2.6 mg/L) and was 30-35% higher than previously reported in healthy volunteers.

Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg bd) to 14 healthy volunteers resulted in significant decreases in indinavir AUC (-25%), Cmin (-50%) and Cmax (-17%). Cmin values were similar to those obtained with 800 mg indinavir given three times daily without ritonavir. Efavirenz concentrations were comparable to historical data. The dose of indinavir or ritonavir should be increased to maintain similar concentrations after the addition of efavirenz to a indinavir/ritonavir regimen.

When efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and indinavir (1000 mg three times daily) were given to healthy volunteers, indinavir AUC and Ctrough decreased 33-46% and 39-57% respectively when compared to indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily). Similar differences in indinavir AUC and Ctrough were also observed in HIV+ subjects. Pharmacokinetics of DMP 266 and indinavir multiple oral doses in HIV-1 infected individuals. Fiske WD, Mayers D, Wagner K, et al. 4th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, 1997 abstract 535.Efavirenz/Amprenavir and 2nd PIThis study, ACTG5043, was developed when the routine use of boosted protease inhibitors was not considered standard of care, and the optimal approach to combining PIs with efavirenz was under investigation. ACTG5043 had a relatively complex design and examined PK interactions between amprenavir and efavirenz, both by themselves and when nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir was added. A PK study was conducted after the administration of single doses of amprenavir (600 mg, day 0). Subjects (n=56) received efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 10 days and restarted amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with efavirenz for days 11 to 13 with a PK study on day 14. A second PI (nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily; indinavir 1200 mg twice daily; ritonavir 100 mg twice daily; or saquinavir 1600 mg twice daily) was added to amprenavir and efavirenz on day 15, and a PK study was conducted on day 21. Controls continued amprenavir and efavirenz without a second PI. Amprenavir AUC was 46-61% lower with efavirenz (day 14 vs day 0; P values of <0.05). In the nelfinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir groups, day 21 amprenavir AUCs with efavirenz were higher than AUCs for efavirenz alone. The authors conclude that efavirenz lowered amprenavir AUC, but NFV, IDV or RTV compensated for efavirenz induction.

This study evaluated the association between CYP2B6 metabolizer status and levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics when doubling the implant dose. Levonorgestrel concentrations (median (IQR)) were 537 (529.5-597) pg/mL, 310 (253-344.8) pg/mL and 167 (103-301) pg/mL for normal (n=7), intermediate (n=16) and slow (n=5) metabolizers, respectively. CYP2B6 metabolizer status was correlated with levonorgestrel exposure. Levonorgestrel AUC was 35% lower in intermediate metabolizers and 47% lower in slow metabolizers when compared with normal metabolizers. Efavirenz concentrations were associated with lower levonorgestrel concentrations. This study provides further evidence that CYP2B6 genetic variants influence levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics when combined with efavirenz based antiretroviral therapy.

Increasing the dose of Kaletra tablets to 500/125 (given as two 200/50 tablets and one 100/25 tablet) twice daily coadministered with efavirenz resulted in similar lopinavir concentrations compared to Kaletra tablets 400/100 mg (given as two 200/50 mg tablets) twice daily without efavirenz. Increasing the dose of Kaletra tablets to 600/150 mg (given as three 200/50 mg tablets) twice daily coadministered with efavirenz resulted in significantly higher lopinavir plasma concentrations compared to Kaletra tablets 400/100 mg twice daily without efavirenz. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 9 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir capsules (400/100 mg once daily for 9 days) to 11 HIV- subjects resulted in decreases in lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 3%, 19% and 39% respectively, when compared to data from 7 subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir alone. Efavirenz Cmax decreased by 9% and AUC and Cmin both decreased by 16% (compared to data from 12 subjects receiving efavirenz alone). Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 9 days) and Kaletra tablets (500/125 mg twice daily for 10 days) was studied in 19 HIV- subjects. When compared to values obtained with Kaletra tablets alone (400/100 mg twice daily), coadministration at the higher dose increased lopinavir Cmax (12%) and AUC (6%), and decreased Cmin (10%). Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 9 days) and Kaletra tablets (600/150 mg twice daily for 10 days) was studied in 23 HIV- subjects. When compared to values obtained with Kaletra tablets alone (400/100 mg twice daily), coadministration at the higher dose resulted in an increased lopinavir Cmax (36%), AUC (36%) and Cmin (32%). The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir are unaffected by concurrent efavirenz. Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir capsules and efavirenz resulted in a substantial decrease in lopinavir exposure. With efavirenz, an increase of the lopinavir/ritonavir capsule or oral solution doses by 33% should be considered (4 capsules/~6.5 ml twice daily instead of 3 capsules/5 ml twice daily). Caution is warranted since this dosage adjustment might be insufficient in some patients. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (400/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) decreased lopinavir concentrations by 30-40%. When lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (500/125 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) were coadministered, lopinavir concentrations were similar to lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily without efavirenz. The dosage of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets should be increased to 500/125 mg twice daily when coadministered with efavirenz 600 mg once daily. Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.Coadministration of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (400/100 mg every 12 hours) with efavirenz (600 mg), in 11 (efavirenz plus lopinavir/ritonavir) and 7 (lopinavir/ritonavir alone) subjects, resulted in no change in lopinavir Cmax, a 19% decrease in AUC and a 39% decrease in Cmin. Efavirenz AUC and Cmin both decreased by 16% but there was no alteration in Cmax. An increased dose of lopinavir/ritonavir (500/125 mg twice daily) was  coadmininistered with efavirenz (600 mg once daily) to 19 subjects for  10 days. When compared to lopinavir/ritonavir alone (400/100 mg twice  daily), lopinavir Cmax increased by 12%, ther was no change in AUC and Cmin decreased by 10%. A higher dose of lopinavir/ritonavir (600/150 mg twice daily) was coadmininistered with efavirenz (600 mg once daily) to 23 subjects for 10 days. When compared to lopinavir/ritonavir alone (400/100 mg twice daily), lopinavir AUC and Cmax both increased by 36% and Cmin increased by 32%. The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir were unaltered at all doses. Dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir is recommended for all patients. Lopinavir/ritonavir tablets should not be administered once daily in combination with efavirenz.Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.Two prospective, open-label, non-randomized studies evaluated amprenavir and lopinavir steady-state pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected patients on a background of nucleosides and amprenavir/lopinavir/ritonavir (750/533/133 mg twice daily) with (n=7) or without (n=12) efavirenz (Study 1) and after switching from amprenavir to fosamprenavir (1400 mg twice daily, n=10; Study 2). Efavirenz did not significantly alter amprenavir and lopinavir pharmacokinetic parameters in patients taking amprenavir/lopinavir. Switching to fosamprenavir resulted in an increase in amprenavir Cmin, AUC, and Cmax without changing lopinavir or ritonavir pharmacokinetics or overall tolerability. Amprenavir and lopinavir pharmacokinetics following coadministration of amprenavir or fosamprenavir with lopinavir/ritonavir, with or without efavirenz. Pham PA, Hendrix CW, Barditch-Crovo P, et al. Antivir Ther, 2007, 12(6): 963-969.A dose increase to 533/133 mg was advised when lopinavir/ritonavir capsules were coadministered with efavirenz. As this dose increase is not possible with the new tablet formulation (200/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per tablet), the coadministration of 2 tablets of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) with efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was studied in 21 HIV- subjects. Subjects received 3 lopinavir/ritonavir capsules (400/100 mg twice daily for 10 days) followed by 2 lopinavir/ritonavir tablets with efavirenz for 10 days. Lopinavir PK parameters were determined on days 10 (3 capsules alone) and 20 (2 tablets + EFV). Mean (± sd) lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Ctrough values on day 10 were 11.8±3.3 µg/ml, 95.7±33.7 µg.h/ml and 6.8±3.3 µg/ml, respectively. Cmax, AUC and Ctrough values obtained on day 20 were 10.5±4.0 µg/ml, 84.9±17.8 µg.h/ml and 5.0±2.7 µg/ml, respectively. Coadministration of efavirenz with the lopinavir/ritonavir tablet decreased lopinavir AUC and Ctrough by ~20% and 27%, respectively, compared to the capsule formulation administered alone. The concentrations obtained with the tablet + EFV were within the range of concentrations previously demonstrated to be efficacious in clinical trials. Pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and ritonavir after multiple dose administration of lopinavir/ritonavir tablet coadministered with efavirenz. Klein CE, et al. 8th International Congress on Drug Therapy in HIV Infection, Glasgow, November 2006, abstract P286.As the new lopinavir/ritonavir tablet is a fixed dose combination of 200/50 mg (the capsule dose is 133/33 mg), a dose increase to 533/133 mg when lopinavir/ritonavir is coadministered with efavirenz will not be possible. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir (600/150 mg twice daily) with efavirenz (600 mg once daily). When compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) given alone, lopinavir Cmax and AUC were moderately increased (36%); ritonavir Cmax increased 92% and ritonavir AUC increased 78%. The regimens were generally well tolerated. Pharmacokinetic effect of efavirenz on a new tablet formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir. Klein C, et al. 10th European AIDS Conference, Dublin, November 2005, abstract 4.3/2.Coadministration of an NNRTI (n=25; NVP n=9, EFV n=16) with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) resulted in a 39% decrease in lopinavir Ctrough but no change in Cmax, compared in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily alone n=125). There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking efavirenz and nevirapine. There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=125) and those taking lopinavir/ritonavir (533/133 mg twice daily, n=32) with an NNRTI (NVP n=3, EFV n=29). There was no statistically significant difference in ritonavir Ctrough or Cmax in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily with or without an NNRTI but patients taking lopinavir ritonavir 533/133 mg twice daily with an NNRTI had higher ritonavir Ctrough and Cmax. The number of patients with lopinavir concentrations below the 3000 ng/ml threshold was higher in those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 with an NNRTI compared to those without an NNRTI. However, the number of patients with suboptimal levels was comparable between those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg alone to those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg plus an NNRTI. Similar results were observed when a lower threshold (1500 ng/ml) was used. Therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir/ritonavir given alone or with an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Solas C, Poizot-Martin I, Drogoul M, et al., Br J Pharmacol, 2003, 57: 436-440.The coadministration of efavirenz with 2 NRTIs (n=19) or with 2 NRTIs plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100-532/132 mg twice daily, n=40) was studied in treatment experienced patients. No statistically significant modification in efavirenz plasma concentrations between the two groups was observed. Lack of effect of protease inhibitors co-administration on efavirenz plasma concentrations. Poirier JM, Meynard JL, Zouai O, et al. 5th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Rome, April 2004, abstract 25.The steady-state pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 and 533/133 mg twice daily) when dosed in combination with efavirenz, plus two NRTIs, were assessed in 57 multiple PI-experienced but NNRTI-naive HIV+ subjects. When codosed with efavirenz, the 400/100 mg regimen resulted in lower lopinavir concentrations, (trough concentration = 3.66±2.64 µg/ml) than were observed in previous studies of lopinavir/ritonavir administered without efavirenz. Increasing the lopinavir/ritonavir dose to 533/133 mg increased lopinavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin by 46, 33, and 141%, respectively. Ritonavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin values were increased by 48, 46 and 63%, respectively. The lopinavir trough concentration (5.88±5.53 µg/ml) achieved with the 533/133 mg dose was similar to historical data obtained with lopinavir/r 400/100 mg in the absence of efavirenz (5.49±4.02 µg/ml). Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of lopinavir-ritonavir in combination with efavirenz and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in extensively pretreated human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Hsu A, Isaacson J, Brun S, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2003, 47: 350-359.The coadministration of efavirenz to 4 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in lopinavir Cmin values of 7625 (2870-11200) ng/ml and Cmax values of 14100 (3990-17300) ng/ml. Mean lopinavir concentrations in a group of patients (n=4) receiving lopinavir/ritonavir alone were 5690 (1420-11120) ng/ml for Cmin and 12400 (3920-17300) ng/ml for Cmax. Efavirenz concentrations were 23100 (600-5775) ng/ml for Cmin and 3445 (1000-10173) ng/ml for Cmax. Steady state pharmacokinetics of lopinavir in combination with nevirapine or efavirenz. Degen O, Kurowski M, van Lunzen J, et al. 14th International AIDS Conference, Barcelona, July 2002, abstract TuPeB4573.An interaction study of Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) and efavirenz was performed in healthy volunteers and HIV+ individuals all of whom received Kaletra (400 lopinavir/100 ritonavir mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). In healthy volunteers, efavirenz had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir, with efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin being reduced by 16% or less in the presence of Kaletra. In healthy volunteers, efavirenz resulted in a 19% decrease in the AUC of lopinavir and a 39% decrease in the Cmin of lopinavir; there was no change in the Cmax of lopinavir. In HIV+ individuals, the decrease in lopinavir was 25% for AUC and 44% for Cmin. No dosage adjustment of efavirenz is required when administered with Kaletra. However, Kaletra should be increased by 33% from 400/100 mg to 533/133 mg when coadministered with efavirenz. Assessment of the pharmacokinetic interaction between ABT378/ritonavir and efavirenz in healthy volunteers and in healthy subjects. Bertz R, Lam W, Hsu A, et al. 40th ICAAC, Toronto, September 2000, presentation 424.Efavirenz and Lopinavir/ritonavir/amprenavirThe effect of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on lopinavir/ritonavir/amprenavir (533/133/750 mg twice daily) was investigated in 19 HIV-infected subjects. Subjects received lopinavir/ritonavir/amprenavir without (n=12) or with efavirenz (n=7). Lopinavir concentrations were similar to historical controls receiving lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily, while amprenavir concentrations were lower than those measured following the administration of amprenavir/ritonavir or fosamprenavir/ritonavir in the absence of lopinavir, but similar to those observed in a previous pharmacokinetic study which investigated the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir/fosamprenavir 533/133/1400 mg twice daily. At the doses studied in this small pilot study, efavirenz did not seem to have any inducing effect on either lopinavir or amprenavir, since when comparing drug concentrations in the two groups of subjects, no significant different was observed. However, a wider inter-individual variability in both lopinavir and amprenavir concentrations was observed in the efavirenz group.

Artemether/lumefantrine should be used cautiously with efavirenz because decreased artemether, dihydroartemisinin (active metabolite of artemether), and/or lumefantrine concentrations may result in a decrease of antimalarial efficacy of artemether/lumefantrine.Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.Coadministration of artemether/lumefantrine (half dose [40/240 mg] and standard dose [80/480 mg], administered at 0, 8, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h) with efavirenz was studied in HIV positive, malaria negative patients in a parallel groups. Coadministration with half dose artemether/lumefantrine decreased lumefantrine AUC and Cmax by 53% and 37% (n=6 per group). Coadministration with standard dose artemether/lumefantrine had no effect on lumefantrine AUC (1% decrease) and increased Cmax by 20% (n=15 EFV; n=10 ART naïve).

422,Efavirenz (EFV),Medroxyprogesterone (depot injection),No Interaction Expected,Low,"The effect of the progesterone-base depot (IM injection) contraceptive medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) on efavirenz was investigated in HIV+ women and was found not to alter the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz (4% decrease in AUC, 12% decrease in Cmax, 6% increase in Cmin). The pharmacokinetics and efficacy of DMPA did not appear to be altered in the presence of efavirenz. Coadministration with a medroxyprogesterone sub-cutaneous depot injection has not been studied. Note: coadministration of DMPA with efavirenz plus rifampicin may lead to sub-therapeutic concentrations of MPA at 12 weeks post-dose. Thus, a more frequent administration of DMPA might be needed in women on efavirenz together with rifampicin.","In a 3-month drug interaction study, no significant differences in MPA pharmacokinetic parameters were found between subjects receiving efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy and subjects receiving no antiretroviral therapy. Similar results were found by other investigators, although the MPA plasma levels were more variable in the second study. In both studies, plasma progesterone levels for subjects receiving efavirenz and DMPA remained low consistent with suppression of ovulation. Because of the limited information available, a reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives.Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.The concurrent use of rifampicin and efavirenz (both inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes) on the pharmacokinetics of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) was investigated. Plasma DMPA concentrations were determined pre-dose, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks after DMPA 150 mg injection in presence of both efavirenz and rifampicin treatments. Progesterone levels were measured from week 2 onwards. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of women with sub-therapeutic MPA <0.1 ng/mL (i.e. levels associated with escape ovulation) prior to 12 weeks post-DMPA dose. MPA pharmacokinetics was compared with historical antiretroviral naïve controls without TB who received DMPA. 5/42 women had MPA <0.1 ng/mL at week 12 with 1 having MPA <0.1 ng/mL at week 10 compared to 1/16 at week 12 among historical controls. No participant had progesterone levels >5 ng/mL (suggesting ovulation) throughout the study. Compared to controls, the median AUC over 12 weeks was lower (7.63 vs 12.38 ng.week/mL, p=0.004) and apparent clearance was higher (19,681 vs 12,117 L/week, p=0.004). The concomitant use of DMPA with efavirenz together with rifampicin resulted in a higher MPA clearance compared to controls, leading to sub-therapeutic concentrations of MPA in some women at 10 and 12 weeks post-dose, although progesterone levels associated with ovulation were not observed. The authors suggest that a more frequent dosing of DMPA might be needed in women on efavirenz with HIV-associated TB treated with rifampicin.Potential concern for timing of DMPA injection among women treated for HIV and TB.

Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.A 51-year-old man with HIV infection who was receiving extended-release nifedipine (60 mg/day) developed symptomatic orthostasis and heart block after starting antiretroviral therapy that included nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily). Other medication included losartan-hydrochlorothiazide (100/25 mg per day), atenolol (100 mg/day), clopidogrel (75 mg/day), aspirin (325 mg/day), zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) and lamivudine (150 mg twice daily). He experienced dizziness, fatigue, and hypotension and developed complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm. Electrocardiogram abnormalities abated within 24 hours of discontinuing antiretroviral therapy. Medication was changed to nifedipine (60 mg/day), losartan (50 mg/day), aspirin (81 mg/day) and atenolol (50 mg/day), however, the patient developed orthostatic symptoms after restarting nelfinavir. He was switched successfully to an efavirenz-based regimen (efavirenz 600 mg once daily, stavudine 40 mg twice daily, didanosine 400 mg/day). Subsequent administration of antiretroviral therapy containing indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) with extended-release nifedipine resulted in recurrence of his orthostatic symptoms. Drug therapy at that time consisted of nifedipine (60 mg/day), atenolol (100 mg/day), losartan (50 mg twice daily) and zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) and abacavir (300 mg twice daily).

Approximately 1 week after initiation of efavirenz (600 mg once daily), a 12 h post dose sample gave an efavirenz concentration of 340 ng/ml which was below the target of 1000 ng/ml. It was decided to rapidly taper the phenytoin dosage, to switch to levetiracetam, and to increase efavirenz to 800 mg once daily. Prior to the efavirenz dose increase, a further 12 h sample was obtained (~18 days after initiation of efavirenz); this was 580 ng/ml and again was below target. A sample obtained ~14 days after the last dose of phenytoin and whilst receiving levetiracetam (1000 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (800 mg once daily) showed an efavirenz concentration of 2500 ng/ml. Efavirenz dosage was reduced to 600 mg once daily; a sample collected 3 weeks after dose reduction showed a concentration of 1960 ng/ml. Phenytoin concentrations were measured whilst receiving efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and showed a gradual increase over ~3 weeks from ~11 µg/ml to 23.5 µg/ml (therapeutic range 10-20 µg/ml).

The geometric mean rifabutin AUC following a 300 mg dose was 4.15 µg/ml.h and increased to 4.98 µg/ml.h when the dose was increased in the presence of efavirenz. Cmax was significantly higher following dose increase with efavirenz initiation (0.6 vs 0.4 µg/ml). Efavirenz AUC, Cmax and Cmin obtained with 600 mg rifabutin (203 µmol/L.h, 14.1 µmol/L, 6.0 µmol/L, respectively) were comparable to those obtained in HIV+ historical control subjects (184 µmol/L.h, 12.9 µmol/L, 5.6 µmol/L, respectively; n=35). Efavirenz trough concentrations were below target (3.5 µmol/L) in only 1/15 patients. The increase in rifabutin from 300 mg to 600 mg was adequate to compensate for the drug interaction with efavirenz in most patients.

599,Efavirenz (EFV),Rifampicin,Potential Weak Interaction,High,"In contrast to its effect on other NNRTIs, rifampicin only leads to modest reduction in efavirenz concentrations. No dose adjustment is recommended when efavirenz and rifampicin are administered at standard doses (efavirenz 600 mg once daily, rifampicin 10 mg/kg). The product labels for efavirenz suggest an increase in efavirenz dose from 600 mg to 800 mg once daily with rifampicin in patients weighing 50 kg or more. However, current American NIH and British HIV Association guidelines recommend to maintain efavirenz at 600 mg once daily in the presence of rifampicin irrespective of body weight and to monitor virologic response. A meta-analysis of studies (mainly from African and Asian populations) found that efavirenz C12 or Cmin was within the therapeutic range when the 600 mg daily dose was coadministered with rifampicin-isoniazid. Only one study (in children) had subtherapeutic efavirenz concentrations (possibly due adherence issue, CYP2B6 polymorphism or low efavirenz dosing in children). Although coadministration of efavirenz (400 mg once daily) with rifampicin (10 mg/kg)-isoniazid was associated with limited changes in efavirenz exposure (~25% decrease in C24) in HIV-infected patients without TB, these results need to be confirmed in HIV/TB-coinfected patients. Thus, patients maintained on efavirenz 400 mg once daily (following the results of the ENCORE clinical trial) should increase to efavirenz 600 mg once daily while treated with rifampicin. Doubling the rifampicin dose to 20 mg/kg may be associated with lower efavirenz concentrations and caution is advised if used with the standard efavirenz dose of 600 mg once daily.","If efavirenz is coadministered with rifampicin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an increase in the dose of efavirenz to 800 mg/day may be considered. Coadministration of rifampicin (600 mg once daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) decreased efavirenz AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 26%, 20% and 32%, respectively. When taken with rifampicin in patients weighing 50 kg or greater, increasing efavirenz daily dose to 800 mg may provide exposure similar to a daily dose of 600 mg when taken without rifampicin. The clinical effect of this dose adjustment has not been adequately evaluated. Individual tolerability and virological response should be considered when making the dose adjustment. No dosage adjustment is necessary for rifampicin.Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, December 2017.If efavirenz is coadministered with rifampin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an increase in the dose of efavirenz to 800 mg once daily is recommended. Coadministration of rifampicin (600 mg) with efavirenz (600 mg) in 12 subjects caused a 20% decrease in efavirenz Cmax, a 26% decrease in AUC, and a 32% decrease in Cmin.Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, October 2017.This systematic review analysed 22 studies of efavirenz and rifampicin-isoniazid coadministration in patients from high TB/HIV burden countries. Rifampicin induces CYP2B6 (the enzyme responsible for the majority of efavirenz metabolism) and the product labels for efavirenz recommends an increase in efavirenz dosing from 600 mg to 800 mg once a day, when coadministered with rifampicin to patients weighing 50 kg or more. However, the WHO recommends maintaining the 600 mg once a day dose in high HIV burden countries due to an increased risk of CNS toxicity with increased efavirenz concentrations. This meta-analysis found that efavirenz C12 or Cmin was within the therapeutic range (1000-4000 ng/ml) when the 600 mg daily dose was coadministered with rifampicin-isoniazid. Only in one study (in children) were efavirenz concentrations subtherapeutic and this is likely to be driven by adherence, CYP2B6 polymorphism or low EFV dosing in children. The results of this systematic review support efavirenz dosing of 600 mg once daily with rifampicin-isoniazid administration in coinfected African and Asian patients.Pharmacokinetics of efavirenz in patients on antituberculosis treatment in high human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis burden countries: A systematic review. Atwine D, Bonnet M, & Taburet A-M. British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, 2018, 8:1641-1658.Efavirenz pharmacokinetics were determined in HIV-infected patients without TB receiving EFV (400 mg once daily, with FTC/TDF) and rifampicin-isoniazid at baseline (n=26) and after 4 weeks (n=22) and 12 weeks (n=17) of treatment. Coadministration with rifampicin-isoniazid was associated with limited changes in efavirenz exposure (decreases of 16%, 25% and 16% for Cmax, C24 and AUC at week 12) and concentrations were maintained within the range measured in the ENCORE-1 study irrespective of CYP2B6 genotype. All patients had viral loads below 50 copies/ml at baseline and this was maintained throughout this study. These results suggest that efavirenz can be administered at 400 mg once daily with rifampicin, but these results should be confirmed in HIV/TB-coinfected patients.Pharmacokinetics of efavirenz 400 mg once daily coadministered with isoniazid and rifampicin in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infected individuals.

Droste JA, Kearney BP, Hekster YA, Burger DM. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2006, 41(1): 37-43.Nine cases have been reported of patients stable on efavirenz therapy who developed neuropsychiatric disturbances following the introduction of tenofovir to their antiretroviral regimens. The patients had been stable on efavirenz-containing regimens for a median duration of 31 months (range 5-58) during which no efavirenz related CNS effects were reported. Moderate to severe neuropsychiatric events occurred within 48 h of starting tenofovir in 5 patients, with symptoms developing in the remaining 4 patients after 2 weeks to 24 months after initiation of tenofovir. Treatment was changed in 6/9 patients; 3 switched from tenofovir to nevirapine, 2 to from tenofovir to zidovudine and one discontinued treatment. All 6 patients exhibited marked improvement in CNS intolerance. Of the 3 patients who remained on efavirenz and tenofovir, one had spontaneous progressive improvement within 2 weeks, but two had chronic persistent sleeping disorders. Efavirenz plasma concentrations were available for 2 patients before tenofovir (1.35 and 2.09 µg/ml) and for 4 patients on tenofovir (1.30-1.95 µg/ml). The neuropsychiatric disorders could be either a consequence of an unexplained interaction between efavirenz and tenofovir, or an infrequent tenofovir-related side effect.

729,Efavirenz (EFV),Voriconazole,Potential Interaction,High,"Coadministration of standard doses of efavirenz and voriconazole is contraindicated. Efavirenz significantly decreases voriconazole plasma concentrations while voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrations. When coadministered, the voriconazole maintenance dose must be increased to 400 mg twice daily and the efavirenz dose should be reduced by 50% (i.e., to 300 mg once daily). When treatment with voriconazole is stopped, the initial dosage of efavirenz should be restored. ","Co-administration of efavirenz (400 mg orally once daily) with voriconazole (200 mg orally twice daily) decreased voriconazole AUC and Cmax by 77% and 61%, respectively, while efavirenz AUC and Cmax increased by 44% and 38%, respectively. Following co-administration of efavirenz (300 mg once daily) with voriconazole (400 mg twice daily) voriconazole AUC decreased by 7% and Cmax was increased by 23% compared to voriconazole 200 mg twice daily alone. Efavirenz AUC increased by 17% and Cmax was equivalent compared to efavirenz 600 mg once daily alone. When efavirenz is co-administered with voriconazole, the voriconazole maintenance dose must be increased to 400 mg twice daily and the efavirenz dose should be reduced by 50%, i.e., to 300 mg once daily. When treatment with voriconazole is stopped, the initial dosage of efavirenz should be restored. Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.Efavirenz and voriconazole should not be coadministered at standard doses. Efavirenz significantly decreases voriconazole plasma concentrations, and coadministration may decrease the therapeutic effectiveness of voriconazole. Also, voriconazole significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrations, which may increase the risk of efavirenz-associated side effects. When voriconazole is coadministered with efavirenz, voriconazole maintenance dose should be increased to 400 mg every 12 hours and efavirenz dose should be decreased to 300 mg once daily using the capsule formulation (one 200-mg and two 50-mg capsules or six 50-mg capsules). SUSTIVA tablets should not be broken. Coadministration of voriconazole (400 mg twice daily for 1 day, then 200 mg twice daily for 8 days) and efavirenz (400 mg for 9 days) resulted in decreases in voriconazole Cmax and AUC of 61% and 77%. Efavirenz Cmax and AUC increased by 38% and 44% respectively. Reducing the voriconazole dose (to 300 mg twice daily) and efavirenz dose (to 300 mg daily) resulted in decreases in voriconazole Cmax and AUC of 36% and 55% when compared to values obtained with voriconazole alone (400 mg twice daily for 1 day, then 200 mg twice daily for 2 days). Efavirenz Cmax decreased by 14% and there was no change in AUC when compared to values obtained with efavirenz alone (600 mg once daily for 9 days). Coadministration of voriconazole (400 mg twice daily for 5 days) and efavirenz (300 mg once daily for 7 days) resulted in a 23% increase in voriconazole Cmax and a 7% decrease in AUC when compared to values obtained with voriconazole alone (400 mg twice daily for 1 day, then 200 mg twice daily for 2 days). There was no change efavirenz Cmax and a 17% increase in AUC when compared to values obtained with efavirenz alone (600 mg once daily for 9 days).Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.Different dose combinations of efavirenz (300 mg once daily) and voriconazole (300 or 400 mg twice daily) were assessed in HIV- subjects (n=16) and compared to standard-dose monotherapy with each drug (efavirenz 600 mg once daily or voriconazole 200 mg twice daily). Coadministration of the lower voriconazole dose decreased voriconazaole AUC (55%) and Cmax (36%) and had no effect on efavirenz AUC, but decreased efavirenz Cmax by 14%. In contrast, coadministration of the higher voriconazole dose decreased voriconazole AUC by 7%, but increased Cmax by 23%; efavirenz AUC increased by 17% and Cmax decreased by 4%. Based on the pharmacokinetic data obtained, the authors concluded that when co-administered, voriconazole dose should be increased to 400 mg twice daily and efavirenz dose decreased to 300 mg once daily in order to provide systemic exposures similar to standard-dose monotherapy. Pharmacokinetic interactions of efavirenz and voriconazole in healthy volunteers. Damle B, LaBadie R, Crownover P, Glue P. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2008, 65 (4): 523-530.A case report described the use of TDM to manage the voriconazole-efavirenz interaction in an HIV+ subject with cirrhosis, stable on an efavirenz-containing regimen (600 mg once daily) who required voriconazole for treatment of disseminated cryptococcosis following failure of fluconazole and amphotericin/flucytosine. Due to the presence of efavirenz, intravenous voriconazole was added to amphotericin/flucytosine at three times the recommended dose and resulted not only in remission of the cryptococcal clinical symptoms, but also decreased viral load to <50 copies/ml. Trough concentrations were determined on days 11, 23 28 and 35; voriconazole troughs were 2.3, 2.2, 3.9 and 2.8 µg/ml and efavirenz troughs were 4.7, 6.5, 4.7, and 6.5 µg/m, respectively. Voriconazole AUC and Cmax were determined on day 28 and were 35.30 µg.h/ml and 4.81 µg/ml, respectively. Efavirenz AUC and Cmax on the same day were 134.7 µg.h/ml and 8.6 µg/ml, respectively. On day 35, trough concentrations in plasma and CSF were determined and CSF:plasma ratios for voriconazole were 0.35 and for efavirenz were 0.13. The patient was switched to maintenance therapy with oral voriconazole (300 mg twice daily) with efavirenz (600 mg once daily). TDM was performed every three weeks which guided dose modifications, first to decrease efavirenz to 400 mg once daily, and then to decrease both voriconazole (to 200 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (to 300mg once daily). After 15 months of follow up on this regimen, the patient remained symptom free and with an undetectable viral load. Efficacy and safety of TDM assisted combination therapy with voriconazole plus efavirenz in aids patients with cryptococcosis.

Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. These studies suggest that inducers of CYP3A4 (such as efavirenz) may increase metabolism of vitamin D and therefore reduce its effect. Various observational studies have reported increased risk for vitamin D deficiency in patients taking efavirenz containing regimens.
