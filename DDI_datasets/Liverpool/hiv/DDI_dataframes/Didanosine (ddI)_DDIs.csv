Ganciclovir concentrations decreased if given 2h apart, but not if administered simultaneously. If there is no suitable alternative to ganciclovir, patients should be closely monitored for didanosine-associated toxicities.","Coadministration of didanosine with ganciclovir may result in didanosine-associated toxicities. Patients should be closely monitored for didanosine-associated toxicities. Coadministration of ganciclovir (1000 mg every 8 hours, concurrent with or 2 hours after didanosine) and didanosine buffered tablets (200 mg every 12 hours) increased didanosine AUC by 111%. Ganciclovir AUC decreased by 21% when ganciclovir was administered 2 hours after but not concurrent with didanosine. Videx Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2016.Coadministration increases didanosine concentrations. If there is no suitable alternative to ganciclovir, then use in combination with Videx-EC with caution. Monitor for didanosine-associated toxicity. When the buffered formulation of ddI (200 mg twice daily) was coadministered with ganciclovir (1000 mg three times daily, 2 h after ddI) to 12 HIV-negative subjects, ddI AUC increased by 111% and ganciclovir AUC decreased by 21%. Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, December 2018.Coadministration of didanosine (200 mg twice daily) simultaneously with or 2 h before ganciclovir (1000 mg three times daily) was studied in 12 HIV-infected subjects. There were statistically significant decreases in the ganciclovir AUC (23%), Cmax (22%) and Cmin (21%) when given 2 h after didanosine. No significant differences were observed when the two drugs were given simultaneously. There was no significant difference in half life or renal clearance of ganciclovir when the two drugs were administered simultaneously or sequentially. Ganciclovir (simultaneous, sequential) significantly increased didanosine AUC (107%, 115%) and Cmax (108%, 116%). There were statistically significant increases in percentage ddI excreted unchanged in the urine, but no change in renal clearance. When all pharmacokinetic parameters were compared during sequential or simultaneous administration, there were no significant differences. The increased didanosine exposure may result in increased didanosine concentration-related toxicities; similarly, decreases in ganciclovir concentrations may impair its efficacy. For HIV-infected subjects receiving ganciclovir and didanosine, clinicians should recommend administering the two drug simultaneously and patients should be monitored closely for ddI-associated toxicities.

This study investigated the interaction between high dose oral ganciclovir (2000 mg three times daily) and didanosine (200 mg twice daily) in HIV-infected subjects. Didanosine data were available on 12 subjects and ganciclovir data on 8 subjects. When ganciclovir was administered either before didanosine, increases in didanosine AUC (87.3%) and Cmax (58.6%) were observed; when administered 2 h after didanosine, increases in didanosine AUC and Cmax of 100% and 124% were observed. There were no significant effects of didanosine on the pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir, irrespective of sequence of administration. Although the combination was well tolerated in this short term study (3 days), there remains a concern that with long term administration increased didanosine exposure may increase the prevalence of didanosine related side effects.

A decreased dosage of 250 mg didanosine with tenofovir-DF has been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.","The co-administration of didanosine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended. Co-administration of didanosine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk for didanosine-related adverse events. Rare cases of pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. A reduced didanosine dose (250 mg) has been tested to avoid over-exposure to didanosine in case of co-administration with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, but this has been associated with reports of high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at early stage within several tested combinations. Co-administration of didanosine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is therefore not recommended, especially in patients with high viral load and low CD4 cell count. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) didanosine.

Increased exposure may cause or worsen didanosine-related clinical toxicities, including pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine should be undertaken with caution, and patients should be monitored closely for didanosine-related toxicities and clinical response. Didanosine should be suspended if signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia, or lactic acidosis develop. Suppression of CD4 cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily. A dose reduction of didanosine taken together with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a light meal (400 kcalories or less and 20% fat or less) or in the fasted state is recommended.

Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, September 2016.Coadministration of tenofovir-DF and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. When administered with tenofovir-DF, Cmax and AUC of didanosine increased significantly. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir-DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. In patients weighing greater than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg once daily when it is coadministered with tenofovir-DF. In patients weighing less than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 200 mg once daily when it is coadministered with tenofovir-DF. When coadministered, tenofovir-DF and didanosine EC may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal (less than 400 kcal, 20% fat). For additional information on coadministration of tenofovir-DF and didanosine, please refer to the full prescribing information for didanosine. When didanosine 250 mg enteric-coated capsules were administered with tenofovir-DF, systemic exposures of didanosine were similar to those seen with the 400 mg enteric-coated capsules alone under fasted conditions. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and buffered didanosine (250 or 400 mg once daily for 7 days, n=14) had no effect on tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and enteric-coated didanosine (250 mg simultaneously with tenofovir-DF and a light meal) decreased didanosine Cmax by 20% and had no effect on AUC when compared to values obtained with didanosine (400 mg) given alone under fasting conditions.Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Inc, February 2016.Intracellular concentrations of active phosphate metabolites were determined in three groups of HIV-infected subjects receiving didanosine alone (400 mg once daily, n=16), tenofovir (300 mg once daily, n=8) or didanosine/tenofovir (250/300 mg once daily, n =14). There were no significant differences in ddA-TP or TDF-DP when didanosine or tenofovir were administered alone or in combination. This study does not support the existence of a strong intracellular interaction between didanosine and tenofovir, but can not conclude that there is absolutely no interaction due to small sample size. As ddA-TP concentrations were similar when didanosine given alone (400 mg) or at a reduced dose (250 mg) with tenofovir, the study supports the dose adaptation proposed for this combination.
