0,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Abacavir (ABC),No Interaction Expected,Low,"Coadministration of abacavir (600 mg once daily) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) had no effect on atazanavir or ritonavir pharmacokinetics, but decreased abacavir AUC (17%) and Cmax (20%). These changes are unlikely to be clinically significant.","Abacavir has also been shown in vitro not to inhibit CYP 3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Induction of hepatic metabolism has not been observed in clinical studies.

3,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Acenocoumarol,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Induction of CYP2C9 by ritonavir may lead to decreased acenocoumarol exposure. There is a case report of an HIV-infected patient on ART who was receiving the anticoagulant acenocoumarol for secondary prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism. Whilst on either an efavirenz-based or an atazanavir/ritonavir-based regimen, the average acenocoumarol dose was increased to maintain INR in the target range. Eventually the patient was stabilised on a raltegravir regimen.","A case report describes an HIV-infected patient on ART who was receiving the anticoagulant acenocoumarol for secondary prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism. Whilst on either an efavirenz-based or an atazanavir/ritonavir-based regimen, the average acenocoumarol dose was increased to maintain INR in the target range. This implies an induction effect of both efavirenz and atazanavir/ritonavir, presumably on the major enzyme CYP2C9. Eventually, the patient was stabilised on a raltegravir regimen.Interaction between antiretroviral drugs and acenocoumarol. Welzen ME, van den Berk GE, Hamers RL, Burger DM.

4,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Acetazolamide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acetazolamide is primarily excreted unchanged via the kidneys.,(See Summary)
5,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Aciclovir (Acyclovir),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as aciclovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1.

6,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Acitretin,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acitretin undergoes isomerisation and glucuronidation.,(See Summary)
7,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Aclidinium bromide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

10,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Adrenaline (Epinephrine),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated, mostly in the liver by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO).",(See Summary)
11,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),African Potato,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. African potato was shown to inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp in vitro and to activate PXR suggesting that inhibition may occur initially followed by induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp when used for extended periods. However, coadministration of African potato with lopinavir/ritonavir in healthy volunteers did not result in significant pharmacokinetic changes suggesting that boosting by ritonavir could offset the inducing effect of African potato.",(See Summary)
12,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Agomelatine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Agomelatine is metabolised predominantly by CYP1A2 which is induced by ritonavir. Coadministration with atazanavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease agomelatine exposure. Monitor clinical effect and increase dosage if needed.,(See Summary)
13,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Albendazole,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 and the flavine-containing monooxygenase system are involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. Short term (2 doses) coadministration with ritonavir (200 mg) did not impact albendazole pharmacokinetics whereas long-term coadministration (8 days) decreased albendazole exposure likely due to ritonavir inducing effect. Atazanavir/ritonavir is unlikely to significantly affect albendazole exposure when used for a short duration treatment but may reduce the clinical effect of albendazole when used for a long duration treatment.,"In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400 mg albendazole, in the absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir.Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

14,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Albuvirtide,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Albuvirtide is a peptide which is eliminated by catabolism to its constituent amino acids. Based on data from studies with lopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations of atazanavir/ritonavir may decrease but this is not expected to be clinically relevant. Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. However, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone (lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 37%, 33% and 35%, respectively; ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 38%, 39% and 28%, respectively). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 µg/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy. Furthermore, a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study) showed that albuvirtide + lopinavir/ritonavir was non-inferior to the standard second-line regimen lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine in HIV infected Chinese individuals suggesting that this interaction has no clinical consequences. In vitro human microsomal studies indicate that albuvirtide has no inducing properties on P450 enzymes. In addition, albuvirtide binds to <1% of serum albumin in the range of clinical concentrations, thus the observed decrease in lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations is unlikely to result from protein binding displacement. However, binding of the albuvirtide-albumin complex to the HIV protease inhibitor cannot be excluded.","Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 9 HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. Conversely, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone. The mean ratios (90% CI) of AUC, Cmax and Ctrough for lopinavir were 0.63 (0.49-0.82), 0.67 (053-0.86) and 0.65 (0.46-0.91). For ritonavir, AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 0.62 (0.42-0.91), 0.61 (0.38-0.99) and 0.72 (0.40-1.26).

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma viral load <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Non-inferiority was pre-specified with a margin of 12%. Interim analysis of 48 week data from 46 subjects in the albuvirtide group and 50 patients in the control group showed 80.4% patients in the albuvirtide group had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL versus 66.0% in the control group (difference 14.4%, 95% CI -3.0% -31.9%), meeting the non-inferiority criteria.Efficacy and safety of long-acting HIV fusion inhibitor albuvirtide in antiretroviral-experienced adults with HIV-1: interim 48-week results from the randomized, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority TALENT study.

In vitro data indicate that beclometasone is a pro-drug which is hydrolysed via esterase enzymes to the highly active metabolite beclometasone-17-monopropionate. This active metabolite is subsequently converted to inactive metabolites via CYP3A4/5. Coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (160 mg twice daily) increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate by 108% and 67%, respectively. However, coadministration of a boosted PI (darunavir/ritonavir, 600/100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. Although statistically significant, the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir is unlikely to be of clinical significance as no significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir.

74,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Betamethasone,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Betamethasone is metabolized by CYP3A4 and coadministration may therefore lead to elevated corticosteroid levels, Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal axis suppression. A case of Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression in a patient on atazanavir/ritonavir and dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops and betamethasone 0.1% eye ointment has been reported. Betamethasone is a moderate inducer of CYP3A4. Caution is needed when betamethasone is administered orally or intravenously at high doses or for a long duration as it may decrease atazanavir/ritonavir exposure.","A case report describes a 51-year-old woman with HIV who presented with weight gain and a 1-month history of right hip pain. Her ART included tenofovir (300 mg once daily), emtricitabine (200 mg once daily), and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily). Because of previous bilateral cytomegalovirus retinitis, complicated by immune recovery uveitis with severe, chronic, cystoid macular oedema, she was also using dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops six times daily, and betamethasone 0.1% eye ointment at night, in both eyes. On examination, she was noted to have central adiposity and enlargement of the dorsocervical fat, but no peripheral lipoatrophy. An MRI scan of the hip showed avascular necrosis. A tetracosactide (Synacthen) stimulation test showed marked suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis, with a baseline cortisol of less than 25 nmol/L rising to only 37 nmol/l 30 min after administration of tetracosactide 250mg (normal response at 30 min, >570 nmol/L). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was undetectable. The presence of adrenal axis suppression with low ACTH, in the context of Cushingoid features and avascular necrosis of the hip, suggested ongoing exposure to high systemic levels of exogenous corticosteroids. Ritonavir and atazanavir were substituted with efavirenz (600 mg once daily) while continuing the steroid eye drops. Oral hydrocortisone 15 mg daily was added to avoid precipitating crisis due to adrenal insufficiency. Over the following year, the patient’s weight declined, with marked improvement in her adrenal function. Analysis of stored serum samples revealed elevated levels of dexamethasone at presentation (1.4-1.7 nmol/L) which fell dramatically after discontinuation of protease inhibitor therapy (undetectable to 0.181 nmol/L). Although prior courses of oral and intravenous corticosteroids may have contributed to adrenal axis suppression, the close temporal correlation between discontinuation of ritonavir, reversal of weight gain and recovery of adrenal function, combined with detectable levels of dexamethasone in the blood, strongly suggests that co-administration of ritonavir was responsible for the accumulation of excessive systemic levels of topical ocular corticosteroids, resulting in adrenal axis suppression and Cushing’s syndrome.Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal axis suppression in a patient treated with ritonavir and corticosteroid eye drops.

The patient's diarrhoea improved, but he was admitted 12 days later with 10.4 kg weight gain, severe leg and facial swelling, and uncontrolled hypertension.  Physical examination was notable for blood pressure 177/102 mm Hg, Cushingoid facies, and 2+ pedal and pretibial edema to the knees.  As the colitis had improved dramatically with budesonide therapy, the plan was to continue it for a full 6-week treatment course, if possible. Amlodipine, hydralazine, and furosemide were added to control the hypertension and edema, but budesonide was discontinued after 3 weeks because of persistent severe edema that was refractory to furosemide.

Drug Alcohol Depend, 2007, 91(2-3): 269-278.Three case reports have recently been published on a pharmacokinetic interaction between buprenorphine and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir. The first subject had been titrated to a stable dose of buprenorphine 14 mg/day prior to the commencement of ddI (250 mg), tenofovir (300 mg) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg), all given once daily. The next day the subject began to experience daytime somnolence and decreased mental functioning. After two weeks, during which the subject was offered additional counselling, buprenorphine was decreased to 8 mg/day and this resulted in tolerance to the sedative effects after 7 days. The subject was finally stabilised on buprenorphine 10 mg/day. The second subject was stable on once daily ddI (250 mg), tenofovir (300 mg), atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg) and twice daily olanzapine (5 mg) prior to induction with buprenorphine (8 mg/day). On the second day of induction, the subject reported feeling “doped up“, and required a dose reduction of buprenorphine to 8 mg every other day to improve the feelings of opiate excess. The third subject had been receiving lamivudine (300 mg), tenofovir (300 mg) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg) once daily prior to the initiation of buprenorphine (8 mg/day). Following the commencement of buprenorphine, the subject reported feeling dizzy, “high“ and “over-medicated“. Buprenorphine was reduced to 8 mg every other day; however, though this improved the dizziness the corresponding opiate cravings required dose modification to 8 mg daily and a further dose increase to 12 mg daily. At this dose, the subject experienced hypersomnolence but elected to remain on the higher dose as it suppressed the opiate craving. Tolerance developed over a week and the hypersomnolence gradually ceased. Phase I metabolism of buprenorphine is primarily by CYP3A4 to norbuprenorphine, with phase II metabolism being mainly through glucuronidation. The authors postulate that atazanavir and/or ritonavir inhibited CYP3A4-mediated metabolism, with atazanavir having an additional inhibitory effect on glucuronidation, resulting in increased concentrations of buprenorphine and clinical symptoms of opiate excess. They recommend caution if using buprenorphine with atazanavir or ritonavir and suggest beginning with reduced doses of buprenorphine and slower dose escalation to allow for assessment of opiate excess. Three case reports of a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction with buprenorphine and atazanavir plus ritonavir.

103,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Carbidopa,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Enhanced levodopa effects including severe dyskinesia were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir/ritonavir.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsons's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinson’s had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in the daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Ciclesonide can be administered with atazanavir/ritonavir without dose adjustment, but with close monitoring. There is a risk of steroid side effects occurring, particularly if a high dose is used, or in case of prolonged administration, or if used with another medicine containing corticosteroids. These side effects are also more likely during periods of physiological stress. Ciclesonide is a pro-drug activated by esterases in the lungs to des-ciclesonide which then undergoes CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 7 days) with orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 µg once daily) did not alter ciclesonide but resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the AUC and a 2-fold increase in the Cmax of des-ciclesonide. Ciclesonide is mainly absorbed by the lungs, has a high protein binding and a high clearance resulting in a lower potential to cause systemic effects compared to some other inhaled corticosteroids.

A dose equivalent to famotidine 40 mg twice daily should not be exceeded.Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, October 2018.Atazanavir solubility decreases as pH increases. Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if H2-receptor antagonists are administered with Reyataz. Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when Reyataz 400 mg once daily was administered simultaneously with famotidine 40 mg twice daily in adults, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance.In treatment-naive adult patients: Reyataz 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food should be administered simultaneously with, and/or at least 10 hours after, a dose of the H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA). An H2RA dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg once daily up to a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg twice daily can be used with Reyataz 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg in treatment-naïve patients. For patients unable to tolerate ritonavir, Reyataz 400 mg once daily with food should be administered at least 2 hours before and at least 10 hours after a dose of the H2RA. No single dose of the H2RA should exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg, and the total daily dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg. The use of Reyataz without ritonavir in pregnant women is not recommended.In treatment-experienced adult patients: Whenever an H2RA is given to a patient receiving Reyataz with ritonavir, the H2RA dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg twice daily, and the Reyataz and ritonavir doses should be administered simultaneously with, and/or at least 10 hours after, the dose of the H2RA.• Reyataz 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with an H2RA.• Reyataz 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with both tenofovir DF and an H2RA.• Reyataz 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with either tenofovir DF or an H2RA for pregnant women during the second and third trimester. Reyataz is not recommended for pregnant women during the second and third trimester taking Reyataz with both tenofovir DF and an H2RA.Reyataz US Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2018.Trough atazanavir concentrations were available in 15 patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and 19 patients receiving an H2 receptor antagonist (H2). The mean atazanavir trough concentration in the PPI group was 0.65 µg/ml (range <0.05 to 1.85 µg/ml) compared to 1.12 µg/ml (range <0.05 to 3.17 µg/ml) in the H2 group. Concentrations were below target (0.27 µg/ml) in 6/15 in the PPI group, even though 5 of these were receiving boosted atazanavir. Inadequate levels were observed in 4/20 in the H2 group, 2 of whom were receiving boosted atazanavir. These results suggest a negative effect of proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists on atazanavir concentrations and that boosting with ritonavir does not ensure adequate concentrations.

Clarithromycin is metabolized by CYP3A4 and concentrations may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by atazanavir/ritonavir. In addition, clarithromycin may increase atazanavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations. Coadministration with atazanavir alone increased atazanavir and clarithromycin exposure and reduced exposure of the active metabolite, 14-OH clarithromycin, by 70%. The European SmPC for atazanavir states ""No recommendation regarding dose reduction [of clarithromycin] can be made"" and ""a dose reduction of clarithromycin may result in subtherapeutic concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin"", but the US Prescribing Information suggests a 50% reduction in clarithromycin dose should be considered. Clarithromycin has been shown to prolong the QT interval. When clarithromycin is coadministered with other medicinal products that prolong the QTc interval, such as atazanavir, an additive or synergistic effect on QT prolongation cannot be excluded. Alternative antibiotics should be considered.","No recommendation regarding dose reduction can be made; therefore, caution should be exercised if Reyataz is coadministered with clarithromycin. Coadministration of clarithromycin (500 mg, twice daily) with atazanavir (400 mg, once daily) was studied in healthy volunteers.

Atazanavir AUC and Cmin increased 28% and 91%, respectively, while Cmax was unchanged. A dose reduction of clarithromycin may result in subtherapeutic concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin. The mechanism of the clarithromycin/atazanavir interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition. Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, October 2018.Coadministration is expected to increase atazanavir and clarithromycin concentrations but decrease 14-OH clarithromycin concentrations. Increased concentrations of clarithromycin may cause QTc prolongations; therefore, a dose reduction of clarithromycin by 50% should be considered when it is coadministered with Reyataz. In addition, concentrations of the active metabolite 14-OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced; consider alternative therapy for indications other than infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex.

146,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Clopidogrel,Do Not Coadminister,Low,"Coadministration of clopidogrel and boosted regimens has been evaluated in clinical studies. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite both by 69% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). In HIV-negative subjects (n=12), coadministration of clopidogrel and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 51% and 48%. Importantly, the decrease in clopidogrel’s active metabolite lead to insufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation in 44% of the patients treated with clopidogrel and ritonavir or cobicistat. Consistently, the study in HIV-negative subjects showed that the average inhibition of platelet aggregation was decreased from 51% (clopidogrel alone) to 31% (clopidogrel + ritonavir). Of interest, the study with HIV-infected patients showed a comparable decrease in prasugrel’s active metabolite AUC (52% decrease), however this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. The differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect is in line with clinical observations. Early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Taken together these data suggest that given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites.

Subjects ingested either placebo or clopidogrel (300 mg followed by 75 mg the two following days) alone and together with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Ritonavir significantly decreased the exposure of clopidogrel AM by 51% and average platelet inhibition significantly decreased from 51% without ritonavir to 31% with ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -27% to -12%). The maximal platelet inhibition by clopidogrel was also reduced from 60% to 40% during concurrent ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -29% to -11%). The authors conclude that patients receiving ritonavir are at risk for diminished clopidogrel response and consequently increased risk for atherothrombotic events if the two drugs are used concurrently.

However, dabigatran AUC and Cmax decreased by 29% and 27%, respectively, when coadministered separately to ritonavir. There were no significant changes to thrombin time in either arm of the ritonavir study.

In individuals with normal renal function, predicted Ctrough were within dabigatran therapeutic range (28-210 ng/ml) when dabigatran was administered concurrently with or 2 hours before verapamil at a dose of 150 mg twice daily. However, Ctrough was below the lower limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered at 110 mg twice daily 2 hours before verapamil but still within the therapeutic range in case of simultaneous administration. In individuals with mild renal impairment, predicted Ctrough exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered concurrently or 2 hours before verapamil at a dose of 150 mg twice daily but were within the therapeutic range when administered at a dose of 110 mg twice daily. In individuals with moderate renal impairment, predicted Ctrough exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered concurrently with and 2 hours before verapamil at a dose of 110 mg twice daily but were within the therapeutic range when administered at a dose of 75 mg twice daily. Finally, in individuals with severe renal impairment, predicted Ctrough exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered concurrently with verapamil at a dose of 75 mg twice daily. This study indicates that dabigatran dosage in presence of a P-gp inhibitor such as verapamil varies depending on the renal function. These results suggest that, when coadministered with verapamil, one (110 mg twice daily) and two-stage (75 mg twice daily) reductions of the dabigatran dose are required for individuals with mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively.Assessing potential drug-drug interactions between dabigatran etexilate and a P-gp inhibitor in renal impairment population using PBPK modeling.

Analysis of stored serum samples revealed elevated levels of dexamethasone at presentation (1.4-1.7 nmol/L) which fell dramatically after discontinuation of protease inhibitor therapy (undetectable to 0.181 nmol/L). The clinical time-course strongly suggests that co-administration of ritonavir was responsible for the accumulation of excessive systemic levels of topical ocular dexamethasone. A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid may be necessary with monitoring for symptoms of hypercorticism. Chronic or high doses of dexamethasone may also decrease atazanavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations due to CYP3A4 induction with the possible loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. Use with caution.","A case report describes a 51-year-old woman with HIV who presented with weight gain and a 1-month history of right hip pain. Her ART included tenofovir (300 mg once daily), emtricitabine (200 mg once daily), and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily). Because of previous bilateral cytomegalovirus retinitis, complicated by immune recovery uveitis with severe, chronic, cystoid macular oedema, she was also using dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops six times daily, and betamethasone 0.1% eye ointment at night, in both eyes. On examination, she was noted to have central adiposity and enlargement of the dorsocervical fat, but no peripheral lipoatrophy. An MRI scan of the hip showed avascular necrosis. A tetracosactide (Synacthen) stimulation test showed marked suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis, with a baseline cortisol of less than 25 nmol/L rising to only 37 nmol/l 30 min after administration of tetracosactide 250mg (normal response at 30 min, >570 nmol/L). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was undetectable. The presence of adrenal axis suppression with low ACTH, in the context of Cushingoid features and avascular necrosis of the hip, suggested ongoing exposure to high systemic levels of exogenous corticosteroids. Ritonavir and atazanavir were substituted with efavirenz (600 mg once daily) while continuing the steroid eye drops. Oral hydrocortisone 15 mg daily was added to avoid precipitating crisis due to adrenal insufficiency.

Analysis of stored serum samples revealed elevated levels of dexamethasone at presentation (1.4-1.7 nmol/L) which fell dramatically after discontinuation of protease inhibitor therapy (undetectable to 0.181 nmol/L). Although prior courses of oral and intravenous corticosteroids may have contributed to adrenal axis suppression, the close temporal correlation between discontinuation of ritonavir, reversal of weight gain and recovery of adrenal function, combined with detectable levels of dexamethasone in the blood, strongly suggests that co-administration of ritonavir was responsible for the accumulation of excessive systemic levels of topical ocular corticosteroids, resulting in adrenal axis suppression and Cushing’s syndrome.Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal axis suppression in a patient treated with ritonavir and corticosteroid eye drops.

196,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Docetaxel,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Coadministration with ritonavir may increase concentrations of docetaxel and increase the risk of severe toxicities. There have been several case reports of severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity when coadministered with ritonavir, a potent CYP3A inhibitor. Ideally avoid coadministration with boosted protease inhibitors or consider using an alternative taxane.","Three cases have been reported where administration of IV docetaxel to HIV+ patients on ritonavir-containing regimens resulted in severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity 3-7 days after the first infusion of docetaxel (70-100 mg/m2), despite patients having normal baseline liver function and blood cell counts. Each patient recovered following the withdrawal of docetaxel. Severe toxicity related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. Mir O, Dessard-Diana B, Louet AL, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2010, 69(1): 99-101.A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours. One cohort of patients (n=4) received 10 mg of oral docetaxel and a subsequent cohort (n=8) 100 mg of oral docetaxel, coadministered with 100 mg oral ritonavir randomized to simultaneous administration or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel on days 1 and 8. On day 15 or 22, patients received 100 mg i.v. docetaxel. Docetaxel AUC in patients who received 10 mg oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was low, and the dose could safely be increased to 100 mg. The AUC in patients who received 100 mg oral docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was 2.4 ± 1.5 and 2.8 ± 1.4 mg/L.h, respectively, compared with 1.9 ± 0.4 mg/L.h after i.v. docetaxel. The apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was >100% (i.e. 131 ± 90% and 161 ± 91%, respectively), indicating marked inhibition by ritonavir of gut wall and/or hepatic metabolism. Coadministration of ritonavir significantly enhanced the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel and caution is essential when giving docetaxel with boosted PIs. Coadministration of ritonavir strongly enhances the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel in patients with solid tumors.

Studies using a cocktail of probe drugs showed Echinacea inhibited CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity, and induced hepatic CYP3A activity. However, coadministration of Echinacea and lopinavir/ritonavir showed no clinically significant effect of Echinacea on lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations (most likely due to the potent CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir). Based on these data, Echinacea is unlikely to alter atazanavir/ritonavir exposure.","The effect of echinacea on CYP activity was assessed by use of a number of CYP probe drugs (caffeine for CYP1A2; tolbutamide for CYP2C9; dextromethorphan for CYP2D6 and midazolam for both hepatic and intestinal CYP3A) in a study in 12 healthy volunteers. The data demonstrated that echinacea caused inhibition of CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity and induction of hepatic CYP3A activity. The authors indicate that for CYP3A substrates (such as protease inhibitors), the type of drug interaction observed with echinacea will be dependent on the relative extraction of the drugs at hepatic and intestinal sites and will not be readily predicted.

For patients not taking tenofovir, if Reyataz 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg and H2-receptor antagonists are coadministered, a dose equivalent to famotidine 20 mg twice daily should not be exceeded. If a higher dose of an H2-receptor antagonist is required (e.g., famotidine 40 mg twice daily or equivalent) an increase of the Reyataz/ritonavir dose from 300/100 mg to 400/100 mg can be considered. Coadministration of famotidine (20mg and 40 mg twice daily) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg, once daily) was studied in HIV positive patients.

Famotidine 20 mg once daily up to 40 mg twice daily can be used with Reyataz 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg in treatment-naïve patients. For treatment-naïve patients unable to tolerate ritonavir, Reyataz 400 mg once daily with food should be administered at least 2 hours before and at least 10 hours after a dose of the H2RA. No single dose should exceed famotidine 20 mg, and the total daily dose should not exceed famotidine 40 mg. The use of Reyataz without ritonavir in pregnant women is not recommended.In treatment-experienced adult patients: whenever an H2RA is given to a patient receiving Reyataz with ritonavir, the H2RA dose should not exceed famotidine 20 mg twice daily, and the Reyataz and ritonavir doses should be administered simultaneously with, and/or at least 10 hours after, the dose of the H2RA.• Reyataz 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with an H2RA.• Reyataz 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with both tenofovir DF and an H2RA.• Reyataz 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with either tenofovir DF or an H2RA for pregnant women during the second and third trimester.

The lower famotidine dose, when administered simultaneously in the absence of tenofovir, had no effect on atazanavir Cmin, but decreased atazanavir AUC by 13%. The same dose administered temporally separated in the presence of tenofovir decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 21%, 21% and 19%, respectively. The higher dose of famotidine, administered either simultaneously or temporally separated reduced atazanavir exposure by 20-23% in subjects not receiving tenofovir and by 23-25% in subjects receiving tenofovir. Effects of famotidine on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir when given with ritonavir with or without tenofovir in HIV-infected subjects. Wang X, Chung E, Mahnke L, et al. 10th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Amsterdam, April 2009, abstract P30.The effect of famotidine (20 mg twice daily dosed with or 2 h apart, 40 mg once daily dosed 12 h apart, or 40 mg twice daily) on atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) was studied in 20 HIV- subjects. Atazanavir exposures were similar when given alone or with famotidine 20 mg twice daily (both together and apart) or with 40 mg once daily. Decreases in atazanavir exposure (AUC 21%, Cmax 26%, and Cmin 28%) were seen when famotidine 40 mg was given twice daily. Effect of famotidine 20 and 40 mg dosing regimens on the bioavailability of atazanavir with ritonavir in combination with tenofovir in healthy subjects. Agarwala S, et al. 14th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Los Angeles, February 2007, abstract 568.Two studies were designed to evaluate the effect of the H2 antagonist famotidine (40 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of ATV in groups of healthy subjects (n=16). In one study, subjects received ATV 400 mg alone for 6 days, followed by either ATV + famotidine together, ATV + famotidine + cola together, ATV + famotidine separated (10 h post morning ATV dose and 2 h prior to evening ATV dose), or ATV 300 mg twice daily + famotidine + RTV (100 mg twice daily). In the second study, following 10 days of ATV/RTV (300/100 mg twice daily), subjects received ATV/RTV + famotidine, ATV/RTV + famotidine + cola, or ATV/RTV (400/100 mg) + famotidine. When compared to ATV 400 mg alone, the addition of famotidine reduced ATV AUC and Cmin by 41% and 42% respectively. Separating the administration of ATV and famotidine reduced the effect on AUC and Cmin (GMR 0.95 and 0.79 respectively). The addition of RTV to ATV 300 mg with famotidine resulted in increased AUC (79%) and Cmin (546%). Relative to a boosted 300/100 mg regimen, famotidine reduced ATV AUC and Cmin by 18% and 28% respectively. Increasing ATV to 400 mg when given with famotidine and RTV produced similar AUC and Cmin (GMR 1.03 and 0.86 respectively). The administration of cola did not mitigate the effects of famotidine in either study. The authors concluded that patients receiving ATV 400 mg unboosted and who require famotidine can either switch to ATV/RTV 300/100 mg twice daily, or remain on an unboosted regimen, but take famotidine 10 h after and 2 h prior to ATV. Patients on boosted ATV regimens (ATV/RTV 300/100 mg twice daily) should increase ATV to 400/100 mg when given with famotidine. Pharmacokinetic effect of famotidine on atazanavir with and without ritonavir in healthy subjects. Agarwala, S et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 11.Trough atazanavir concentrations were available in 15 patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and 19 patients receiving an H2 receptor antagonist (H2). The mean atazanavir trough concentration in the PPI group was 0.65 µg/ml (range <0.05 to 1.85 µg/ml) compared to 1.12 µg/ml (range <0.05 to 3.17 µg/ml) in the H2 group. Concentrations were below target (0.27 µg/ml) in 6/15 in the PPI group, even though 5 of these were receiving boosted atazanavir. Inadequate levels were observed in 4/20 in the H2 group, 2 of whom were receiving boosted atazanavir. These results suggest a negative effect of proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists on atazanavir concentrations and that boosting with ritonavir does not ensure adequate concentrations.

272,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Fentanyl,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Fentanyl undergoes extensive CYP3A4 metabolism. Coadministration may increase fentanyl concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of fentanyl until stable drug effects are achieved. Discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease fentanyl concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. When discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors in fentanyl-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur. Note, the use of fentanyl in a non-therapeutic setting (i.e., as a recreational drug) should be avoided with atazanavir/ritonavir as fentanyl exposure is expected to significantly increase and serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Patients should be aware that recreational use could be potentially fatal.",(See Summary)

Wire MB, et al. 10th European AIDS Conference, Dublin, November 2005, abstract 4.3/9.Trough concentrations of atazanavir and amprenavir were determined over 12 weeks in HIV+ patients receiving atazanavir/fosamprenavir/ritonavir (150/700/100 mg twice daily, n=9 or 200/700/100 mg twice daily, n=5). Atazanavir concentrations at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 were 0.96, 1.66, 1.55 and 1.0 µg/ml for 150 mg twice daily and 1.15, 0.77, 1.36 and 1.07 µg/ml for 200 mg twice daily. Amprenavir concentrations at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 were 1.19, 2.19, 2.71, 1.85 µg/ml when given with atazanavir 150 mg twice daily and 2.71, 1.88, 2.58 and 2.43 µg/ml when given with atazanavir 200 mg twice daily. Overall clinical tolerance was excellent and the results appear to indicate that either combination could offer adequate trough concentrations for both drugs.Interaction between atazanavir and fosamprenavir in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. Khanlou et al. 3rd IAS Conference, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, July 2005, abstract WePe3.3C11.ATV and APV trough concentrations were monitored in 7 patients receiving ATV (300 mg once daily) and FPV/RTV (700/100 mg twice daily). All patients achieved full virological suppression over 3-12 months. The median ATV trough concentration was 361 ng/ml (range 271-1336 ng/ml); ATV Cmax (mean ± SD) was 2634 ± 2829 ng/ml). The median APV trough concentration was 2570 ng/ml (range 371-6767 ng/ml); APV Cmax (mean ± ds) was 7381 ± 2723 ng/ml). Interpatient variability was higher for ATV than APV, though trough concentrations for both drugs were above recommended IC90s.Double PI boosting with atazanavir and fos-amprenavir: favourable pharmacokinetics. Zilly, M et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 93.Trough concentrations of atazanavir and amprenavir were obtained 2 weeks after starting therapy in 2 patients receiving atazanavir/fosamprenavir (200/700 mg twice daily) and 5 patients receiving atazanavir/fosamprenavir/ritonavir (150/700/100 mg twice daily). Atazanavir concentrations in the 2 patients on the unboosted regimen were 0.64 and 0.68 µg/ml and were below the range observed for the boosted regimen (0.77-1.63 µg/ml). Amprenavir concentrations in the 2 patients on the unboosted regimen were 2.23 and 2.46 µg/ml and were within the range observed for the boosted regimen (0.40-2.67 µg/ml).

330,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Heroin,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Atazanavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1).

Enhanced levodopa effects including severe dyskinesia were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir/ritonavir.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsons's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinson’s had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Atazanavir alone increased maraviroc AUC by 3.6-fold and Cmax by 2.1-fold; atazanavir/ritonavir further increased maraviroc AUC (4.9-fold) and Cmax (2.7-fold). There were no significant safety or toleration issues.

419,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Mebendazole,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Coadministration of ritonavir and mebendazole for 8 days significantly decreased mebendazole exposure (AUC 57%, Cmax 59%). Administration of mebendazole with cimetidine, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in increased serum levels of mebendazole. The effect of administering atazanavir/ritonavir on mebendazole pharmacokinetics is not known.","In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 1000mg mebendazole, in the absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily. A trend towards an increase in mebendazole exposure after short-term intake of ritonavir was seen. However long-term administration resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC0-24 (57%) and Cmax (59%). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

Coadministration with atazanavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC and Cmin by 19% and 59% and increased Cmax by 2%. The effect on nevirapine pharmacokinetics was not significant. Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.The influence of nevirapine on atazanavir trough concentrations (Ctrough) was studied in a group of HIV-infected patients (n=11) receiving 300/100 mg atazanavir/ritonavir once daily for 2 weeks or longer. Nevirapine was added at a dose of 200 mg once daily from Days 0 to 14 and 200 mg twice daily from Days 14 to 28. Atazanavir and nevirapine plasma Ctroughs were determined at Days 0 and 28. The geometric mean atazanavir Ctrough decreased from 0.631 mg/L (range, 0.235-1.87 mg/L) at Day 0 to 0.316 mg/L (range, 0.142-1.109 mg/L) at Day 28 to give a geometric mean ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.38-0.80; P = 0.026); nonetheless, the atazanavir Ctrough remained higher than the minimum effective concentration in 80% of the participants and higher than the median concentration in historical control subjects receiving 400 mg atazanavir once daily without ritonavir (GMR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.65-6.22; P = 0.001). The authors conclude that monitoring atazanavir Ctrough is recommended in patients treated with this drug combination, and increasing the atazanavir dose might be necessary. Effect of nevirapine on the steady-state trough concentrations of atazanavir in HIV-infected patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir. Molto J, Deig E, Valle M, et al. Ther Drug Monit, 2010, 32(1): 93-96.Trough concentrations were obtained from 16 patients receiving nevirapine once daily (400 mg) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg, n=7; 400/100 mg n=9). Median atazanavir trough concentrations were 340 ng/ml and 520 ng/ml for the 300 mg and 400 mg groups, respectively; values obtained from historical controls receiving 300/100 mg were 610 ng/ml. Nevirapine trough concentrations were 3900 ng/ml and 4000 ng/ml for the two groups and were comparable to literature values for patients treated with nevirapine alone (3700 ng/ml). Given the decrease in atazanavir trough concentrations, relative to historical controls, therapeutic drug monitoring of atazanavir may be appropriate for patients (especially if treatment experienced) receiving this combination. Plasma concentrations of atazanavir in HIV patients treated with regimens including nevirapine. Kurowski M, et al. 8th International Congress on Drug Therapy in HIV Infection, Glasgow, November 2006, abstract 276.Steady-state atazanavir concentrations were assessed in HIV+ patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with and without tenofovir and/or nevirapine. No significant difference was observed in atazanavir concentrations for patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir alone and those taking tenofovir. There was a trend towards decreased atazanavir concentrations for patients co-dosed with nevirapine (with or without tenofovir). These results from a clinical setting suggest that ritonavir boosting of atazanavir reduces the interaction with tenofovir; however, it may not overcome interactions with nevirapine. Interaction between atazanavir/ritonavir and nevirapine is observed in a clinical setting.

503,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Omeprazole,Do Not Coadminister,Moderate,"Coadministration of atazanavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Omeprazole decreased atazanavir (+ritonavir) AUC by 75%. If coadministration is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended and doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20 mg should not be exceeded and must be taken approximately 12 hours prior to the atazanavir/ritonavir. The European SmPC recommends increasing the dose of atazanavir to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir.","Coadministration of omeprazole (40 mg, once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg, once daily, 2 hours after omeprazole) was studied in healthy volunteers. Atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased 61%, 66% and 65%, respectively. Coadministration of omeprazole (20 mg, once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg, once daily, 1 hour after omeprazole) was studied in healthy volunteers. Atazanavir AUC decreased 30% and Cmax and Cmin decreased 31% when compared to atazanavir 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily. The decrease in AUC, Cmax, and Cmin was not mitigated when an increased dose of Reyataz/ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily) was temporally separated from omeprazole by 12 hours. This decrease in atazanavir exposure might negatively impact the efficacy of atazanavir. The mechanism of interaction is decreased solubility of atazanavir as intra-gastric pH increases with proton pump inhibitors. Coadministration of Reyataz with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. If the combination of Reyataz with a proton pump inhibitor is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of Reyataz to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir; doses of omeprazole should not exceed 20 mg. Coadministration of Reyataz without ritonavir is not recommended with proton pump inhibitors.Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, October 2018.Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when Reyataz 400 mg or Reyataz 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg once daily was administered with omeprazole 40 mg once daily in adults, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. In treatment-naive adult patients: omeprazole should not exceed 20 mg and must be taken approximately 12 hours prior to the Reyataz 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg dose. In treatment-experienced adult patients: the use of PPIs in treatment-experienced patients receiving Reyataz is not recommended. Coadministration of omeprazole (40 mg once daily) 2 h before atazanavir (400 mg, once daily) was studied in 16 healthy volunteers. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased 96%, 94% and 95%, respectively. When omeprazole (40 mg single dose) was given 2 hours after atazanavir (400 mg once daily), omeprazole Cmax and AUC increased 24% and 45%, respectively (compared to omeprazole alone 2 hours after a light meal, n=16). Coadministration of omeprazole (40 mg, once daily) 2 h before atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily) was studied in 15 healthy volunteers. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased 72%, 76% and 78%, respectively. Coadministration of omeprazole (20 mg, once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily, 12h after omeprazole) was studied in 13 healthy volunteers. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased 39%, 42% and 46%, respectively. Reyataz 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily separated by 12 hours from omeprazole 20 mg daily resulted in increases in atazanavir geometric mean AUC (10%) and Cmin (2.4-fold), with a decrease in Cmax (29%) relative to Reyataz 400 mg once daily in the absence of omeprazole (study days 1–6). Coadministration of omeprazole (20 mg, once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg, once daily, 1h after omeprazole) was studied in 14 healthy volunteers. Atazanavir AUC decreased 30% and Cmax and Cmin both decreased 31%. Reyataz 400 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily administered with omeprazole 20 mg once daily resulted in increases in atazanavir geometric mean AUC (32%) and Cmin (3.3-fold), with a decrease in Cmax (26%) relative to Reyataz 400 mg once daily in the absence of omeprazole (study days 1-6).Reyataz US Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2018.Coadministration of omeprazole (20 mg, once daily, either in the morning (QAM) or the evening (QPM) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, QPM) was studied in healthy volunteers. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by ~45%, ~35% and ~50%, respectively when the drugs were coadministered simultaneously. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased ~39%, ~42% and ~46%, respectively, when the drugs were administered 12 hours apart. The authors conclude that reducing omeprazole doses from 40 mg to 20 mg can mitigate the decrease in atazanavir exposure seen with coadministration.Effect of low-dose omeprazole (20 mg daily) on the pharmacokinetics of multiple-dose atazanavir with ritonavir in healthy subjects. Zhu L, Persson A, Mahnke L et al. J Clin Pharmacol, 2011, 51(3): 368-377.The effect of a lower dose of omeprazole (20 mg) on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 or 400/100 mg once daily) when given with omeprazole either simultaneously or 12 h apart was studied in groups of HIV- subjects (n=14 per group). When atazanavir was dosed in the evening, giving omeprazole 12 h apart, decreased atazanavir Cmax (39%), AUC (42%) and Cmin (46%); giving omeprazole 12 h apart and increasing atazanavir to 400 mg decreased atazanavir Cmax (29%), AUC (28%) and Cmin (24%). When atazanavir was dosed in the morning, giving omeprazole 1 h prior to atazanavir and increasing atazanavir to 400 mg decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin all by ~30%; giving omeprazole 12 h apart and increasing atazanavir to 400 mg, decreased atazanavir Cmax (20%), AUC (29%) and Cmin (37%). When compared to concentrations obtained with ATV 400 mg alone, all atazanavir + omeprazole combinations resulted in comparable atazanavir AUCs and ~2-fold increases in Cmin. Despite increasing atazanavir to 400 mg, when given with omeprazole atazanavir exposure was decreased by ~30% (relative to 300/100 mg alone) with the effect of omeprazole being similar when given either 1 h before or 12 h apart from ATV.Effect of omeprazole 20 mg daily on the bioavailability of multiple-dose atazanavir with ritonavir in healthy subjects.

Full 24-hour pharmacokinetic analysis was performed before and 7 days into the omeprazole treatment. Each study subject took both PIs under the same conditions and therefore each subject acted as their own control. The addition of 20 mg omeprazole as an evening regimen did not affect amprenavir pharmacokinetics with geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for Cmin, Cmax, and AUC24 all close to 1. In contrast, atazanavir pharmacokinetics were significantly altered with reductions of 27%, 33% and 27% for Cmin, Cmax, and AUC respectively. Steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of once-daily fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/r) and atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) alone and in combination with 20 mg once daily of omeprazole (OMP) in healthy volunteers. Luber A, Brower R, Peloquin C, Frank I. 7th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Lisbon, April 2006, abstract 36.The effect of the proton pump omeprazole (40 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg alone or with cola, or 400/100 mg alone) was investigated in healthy subjects. Atazanavir exposures were substantially reduced with omeprazole in all three groups: Cmin decreased from 1366 ng/ml to 285, 330, 423 ng/ml, Cmax decreased from 5460 to 1522, 1840, 2388 ng/ml and AUC decreased from 60797 to 14605, 18325, 23968 ng/ml.h. Omeprazole exposures were generally comparable to literature values and were similar between groups.

Agarwala S, Gray K, Wang Y, Grasela D. 12th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Boston, February 2005, abstract 658.Trough atazanavir concentrations were available in 15 patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and 19 patients receiving an H2 receptor antagonist (H2). The mean atazanavir trough concentration in the PPI group was 0.65 µg/ml (range <0.05 to 1.85 µg/ml) compared to 1.12 µg/ml (range <0.05 to 3.17 µg/ml) in the H2 group. Concentrations were below target (0.27 µg/ml) in 6/15 in the PPI group, even though 5 of these were receiving boosted atazanavir. Inadequate levels were observed in 4/20 in the H2 group, 2 of whom were receiving boosted atazanavir. These results suggest a negative effect of proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists on atazanavir concentrations and that boosting with ritonavir does not ensure adequate concentrations. Further study of this important issue is warranted. Coadministration of atazanavir with proton-pump inhibitors and H2-blockers.

554,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Prasugrel,No Interaction Expected,Low,"Coadministration of prasugrel with a PI booster has been evaluated in a clinical study. Prasugrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6.

However this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. This same study showed that clopidogrel effect was altered by either cobicistat and ritonavir therefore prasugrel should be preferred in presence of ritonavir-boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects.

Quetiapine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and coadministration with ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased quetiapine AUC by 5-8 fold. The European SmPC for atazanavir contraindicates quetiapine with atazanavir. However, the US Prescribing Information recommends to consider alternative antiretroviral therapy in patients already receiving quetiapine to avoid increases in quetiapine exposures but if coadministration is necessary, to reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adverse reactions. For initiation of quetiapine in patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir, the US label recommends to refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine. Since both drugs can potentially prolong the QT interval, ECG monitoring is recommended if coadministered. There are case reports of two patients who experienced serious quetiapine adverse effects potentially mediated through an interaction with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir; the symptoms resolved promptly after discontinuation of quetiapine.","Coadministration with medicinal products that are substrates of the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450 and have narrow therapeutic windows (e.g. quetiapine) is contraindicated.

A 57-year-old male with HIV and bipolar disease developed rapid and severe weight gain when quetiapine was added to a stable atazanavir/ritonavir-based antiretroviral regimen. After discontinuation of both quetiapine and ritonavir, his weight returned to its baseline value. The second patient (32-year-old female with HIV, anxiety disorder, and a history of intravenous drug abuse) developed increased sedation and mental confusion when an atazanavir/ritonavir-based antiretroviral regimen was added to her stable anti-anxiety drug regimen, which included quetiapine. Her symptoms resolved promptly after discontinuation of the quetiapine. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated that the adverse effects experienced by the two patients were possibly related and probably related, respectively, to an interaction between quetiapine and atazanavir/ritonavir.

A clinical study demonstrated that ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir increased the activity of retinal dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04).

RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

596,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Rifabutin,Potential Interaction,Low,"Coadministration of atazanavir alone and rifabutin had no clinically significant effect on atazanavir exposure, whereas initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed a significant increase in rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) concentrations. Thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and rifabutin (150 mg 3 times a week) resulted in rifabutin Cmax and Ctrough concentrations below the therapeutic levels suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg 3 times a week and atazanavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia).","Coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg, twice weekly) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg, once daily) was studied in healthy volunteers.

When given with Reyataz, the recommended dose of rifabutin is 150 mg 3 times per week on set days (for example Monday-Wednesday-Friday). Increased monitoring for rifabutin-associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to rifabutin. Further dosage reduction of rifabutin to 150 mg twice weekly on set days is recommended for patients in whom the 150 mg dose 3 times per week is not tolerated. It should be kept in mind that the twice weekly dosage of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to rifabutin thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure. No dose adjustment is needed for Reyataz.Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, October 2018.Coadministration is expected to increase rifabutin concentrations.

Blood samples were collected at steady-state for pharmacokinetic analysis. The pharmacokinetic parameters for rifabutin and 25-O-desacteyl rifabutin increased when rifabutin was co-administered twice weekly with atazanavir/ritonavir compared to rifabutin 150 mg once daily alone.

The study was stopped because subjects experienced more severe declines in neutrophil counts when rifabutin was given with atazanavir/ritonavir than alone. However, a post-hoc simulation analysis showed that when rifabutin 150 mg was given three times weekly with atazanavir/ritonavir, the average daily exposure of rifabutin was comparable to rifabutin 300 mg once daily, a dose necessary for reducing rifamycin resistance in HIV/TB co-infected patients. The benefits to HIV/TB co-infected patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg three times weekly or every other day may outweigh the risks of neutropenia observed here in non-HIV-infected subjects, provided that patients on combination therapy will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability.

Haas DW, Koletar SL, Laughlin L, et al. J Aquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2009, 50(3): 290-293.Pharmacokinetics of steady-state atazanavir and ritonavir were evaluated in three HIV/TB co-infected patients treated with a rifampicin-containing regimen (rifampicin 600 mg per day) and antiretroviral therapy including NRTIs plus atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily). Data were compared to historical data for atazanavir alone (400 mg once daily). In all three cases there was a marked decrease in exposure (median of 64% compared to atazanavir alone) and for more than 50% of the time the atazanavir level was below the minimum recommended trough plasma level (150 ng/ml according to current pharmacokinetic guidelines) to inhibit HIV wild-type replication.

The study had to be terminated early due to poor tolerance, which could possibly be related to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir leading to the formation of more toxic metabolites. Use with caution if coadministered due to poor tolerability. In addition, both atazanavir and sorafenib have been shown to prolong the QT/QTc interval.","Coadministration of sorafenib with ritonavir was studied in patients with Kaposi sarcoma in a parallel study. One cohort consisted of patients receiving ritonavir (n=8), and the other of patients not receiving ritonavir (n=2).

Tenofovir AUC and Cmax by 162% and 112% (n=10). No significant effects were observed on atazanavir pharmacokinetics relative to historical controls. The European SmPC for tenofovir alafenamide states that coadministration is not recommended but atazanavir is not mentioned in the US PI. This checker reflects the more cautious option.","Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (200/10 mg once daily) was studied in 10 healthy volunteers in a crossover study. Tenofovir alafenamide AUC and Cmax increased by 91% and 77%, respectively; tenofovir AUC and Cmax increased by 162% and 112%, respectively. Atazanavir pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to historical controls. The authors hypothesise that the increase in tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir exposures are due to the intestinal inhibition of P-gp and/or BCRP by ritonavir.

668,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Tenofovir-DF (TDF),Potential Interaction,Moderate,"In a combined analysis of several clinical studies with tenofovir-DF (300 mg) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg), atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 22%, 16% and 23%, respectively, and tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 37%, 34% and 29%, respectively. Patients should be closely monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse events, including renal disorders. A dose increase to atazanavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg with TDM may be considered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. If atazanavir/ritonavir with tenofovir-DF OR an H2-receptor antagonist are coadministered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, a dose increase to atazanavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg is recommended. It is not recommended to use atazanavir with ritonavir for pregnant patients who are receiving both tenofovir-DF AND an H2-receptor antagonist.","In a combined analysis from several clinical studies, atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (n=39) was compared to atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg (n=33). Atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased 22%, 16% and 23%, respectively. Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg once daily) was studied in healthy volunteers. Tenofovir-DF AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased 37%, 34% and 29%, respectively. The mechanism of interaction between atazanavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is unknown. The efficacy of Reyataz/ritonavir in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in treatment-experienced patients has been demonstrated in clinical study 045 and in treatment naive patients in clinical study 138. When coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, it is recommended that Reyataz 300 mg be given with ritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (all as a single dose with food). Patients should be closely monitored for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-associated adverse reactions, including renal disorders. Reyataz given without ritonavir should not be considered in patients treated with a backbone regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil.Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, October 2018.Tenofovir DF may decrease the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir. When coadministered with tenofovir DF in adults, it is recommended that Reyataz 300 mg be given with ritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir DF 300 mg (all as a single daily dose with food). Reyataz increases tenofovir concentrations. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher tenofovir concentrations could potentiate tenofovir-associated adverse reactions, including renal disorders. Patients receiving Reyataz and tenofovir DF should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg, once daily) with atazanavir (400 mg, once daily) was studied in 34 healthy volunteers. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased 21%, 25% and 40%, respectively. Tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased 14%, 24%, and 22%, respectively (n=33). Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg, once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily) was studied in 12 healthy volunteers. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased 28%, 25% and 23%, respectively (n=10). Tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased 34%, 37% and 29%, respectively. Note that similar results were observed in studies where administration of tenofovir DF and Reyataz was separated by 12 hours. Atazanavir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg results in higher atazanavir exposure than atazanavir 400 mg. The geometric mean values of atazanavir pharmacokinetic parameters when coadministered with ritonavir and tenofovir DF were: Cmax = 3190 ng/mL, AUC = 34459 ng.h/mL, and Cmin = 491 ng/mL.

Tenofovir AUC increased by 37%, Cmax increased by 34% and Cmin increased by 29%. No dose adjustment is recommended. The increased exposure of tenofovir could potentiate tenofovir-associated adverse events, including renal disorders. Renal function should be closely monitored.Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, September 2016.Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily for 14 days) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) to 33 subjects increased tenofovir Cmax (14%), AUC (24%) and Cmin (22%). Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 21%, 25% and 40% respectively. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily for 42 days) increased tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 34%, 37% and 29%, respectively; atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 28%, 25%, and 23%, respectively. In HIV-infected patients, the addition of tenofovir-DF to atazanavir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg, resulted in AUC and Cmin values of atazanavir that were 2.3- and 4-fold higher than the respective values observed for atazanavir 400 mg when given alone. When coadministered with tenofovir-DF, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. Tenofovir-DF should not be coadministered with atazanavir without ritonavir. Patients receiving tenofovir-DF concomitantly with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Tenofovir-DF should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, February 2016.Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg, once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily, with NRTIs) was studied in 20 HIV positive patients. Atazanavir Cmin decreased 3% and Cmax and AUC increased 7% and 8%, respectively. These differences are not statistically significant. Tenofovir comedication does not impair the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir in HIV-1-infected adults. von Hentig N, Dauer B, Haberl A et al., Eur J Clin Pharmacol, 2007, 63(10): 935-940.A study was performed in healthy volunteers to determine whether increasing ATV/RTV from 300/100 mg to 400/100 mg once daily with TDF or maintaining the standard dose but separating administration of TDF by 12 h, could overcome the 25% decrease in ATV exposure previously seen when coadministered with TDF. Relative to ATV/RTV 300/100, simultaneous administration of ATV/RTV 400/100 resulted in increases in ATV AUC and Cmin of 38% and 33% respectively. TDF AUC and Cmin increased by 55% and 70% respectively. Maintaining the standard dose, but separating administration by 12 h, resulted in an 11% decrease in ATV AUC and a 20% decrease in Cmin. TDF AUC and Cmin increased by 37% and 29% respectively. RTV exposure was comparable across treatments. Due to the increases in ATV and higher TDF exposures, coadministration of ATV/RTV 400/100 mg with TDF is not recommended. Separation of ATV/RTV 300/100 mg and TDF doses are not expected to offer any additional clinical advantage over simultaneous administration. Pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and atazanavir coadministered with ritonavir in healthy subjects. Agarwala, S et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 16.The pharmacokinetics of TDF (300 mg once daily), when given with ATV/RTV (300/100 mg once daily), were assessed in a substudy of the Puzzle2-ANRS 107 trial. Full PK profiles were determined in 10 patients: median (range) TDF Cmax, Cmin and AUC were 234 (121-855) ng/ml, 45 (23-215) ng/ml and 2253 (1305-11285) ng/ml.h respectively. Trough concentrations at weeks 6, 10, 18 and 26 were 58, 64, 53 and 57 ng/ml respectively (n=32-38). Tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable to historical data obtained from healthy and HIV+ subjects, suggesting that tenofovir exposure is not substantially altered when coadministered with atazanavir/ritonavir. Pharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir when combined with atazanavir /ritonavir in HIV infected patients with multiple treatment failures: a substudy of Puzzle2- ANRS 107 trial. Taburet, A-M et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 55.Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg, once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily) was studied in 10 male HIV positive patients.

No significant correlation between the decreased atazanavir exposure and the viral response was seen.Interactions between atazanavir-ritonavir and tenofovir in heavily pretreated human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Taburet AM, Piketty C, Chazallon C et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2004, 48(6): 2091-2096.Steady-state atazanavir concentrations were assessed in HIV+ patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with and without tenofovir-DF and/or nevirapine. No significant difference was observed in atazanavir concentrations for patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir alone and those taking tenofovir-DF. There was a trend towards decreased atazanavir concentrations for patients co-dosed with nevirapine (with or without tenofovir). These results from a clinical setting suggest that ritonavir boosting of atazanavir reduces the interaction with tenofovir; however, it may not overcome interactions with nevirapine. Interaction between atazanavir/ritonavir and nevirapine is observed in a clinical setting.

Co-administration of steady-state tipranavir/ritonavir with the first dose of atazanavir caused decreases in tipranavir AUC (39%) and Cmin (70%). At steady state, the decreases in atazanavir AUC and Cmin were larger, being 68% and 81% respectively. Co-administration of steady-state atazanavir with steady-state tipranavir/ritonavir resulted in increases in tipranavir AUC (20%) and Cmin (75%). The overall conclusion was that tipranavir/ritonavir has a marked impact on the PK of atazanavir and that co-administration of tipranavir/ritonavir 500/100 mg twice daily with atazanavir 300 mg once daily is not recommended. Since the licensed dose for tipranavir/ritonavir is 500/200 mg and not 500/100 mg the question of the impact of increased ritonavir remains conjecture. The increase in tipranavir Cmin in the presence of atazanavir is of interest and points to the additional boosting provided by atazanavir. The pharmacokinetic interaction between atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) and steady state tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r) in healthy volunteers.

Due to genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19, voriconazole AUC is on average 2-4 fold higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers (PM) than in extensive metabolisers (EM). In a majority CYP2C19 EM population, low dose ritonavir decreased voriconazole AUC by ~40%, likely due to induction of CYP2C19 by ritonavir. This study assessed the two-way drug interactions when adding voriconazole to atazanavir/ritonavir in both CYP2C19 EM and PM healthy subjects. Voriconazole was administered alone on days 1-3, atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100mg once daily) administered alone on days 11-20, and the drugs coadministered on days 21-30. The voriconazole doses were 200 mg twice daily (400 mg twice daily on days 1 and 21) for EM subjects and 50 mg twice daily (100 mg twice daily on days 1 and 21) for PM subjects. 20 EM and 7 PM subjects completed the study. In EM subjects, coadministration decreased voriconazole AUC and Cmin by 33% and 39%, respectively; atazanavir AUC and Cmin decreased 12% and 20%, respectively. In PM subjects, coadministration increased voriconazole Cmax and AUC by 4-4 fold and 5.6-fold, respectively; atazanavir AUC and Cmin decreased by 20% and 31%, respectively. Ritonavir Cmax and AUC were generally unchanged in either population. The decrease in voriconazole AUC seen in EM subjects, (33%) is similar to the historical observation of 39% when voriconazole was given with low dose ritonavir.

735,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Ziprasidone,Do Not Coadminister,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. The US Prescribing information for ziprasidone contraindicates its use in the presence of other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Coadministration is not recommended due to the potential of life threatening arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death. Approximately two thirds of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is by reduction, with less than one third by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4). Coadministration could potentially increase ziprasidone concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4.",(See Summary)
736,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Zoledronic acid,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zoledronic acid is eliminated unchanged renally.,(See Summary)
737,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Zolpidem,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Zolpidem is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP1A2. Atazanavir/ritonavir could potentially increase zolpidem exposure which could result in increased sedation. A dosage reduction may be required.,(See Summary)
738,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Zonisamide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Zonisamide is metabolized partly by CYP3A4 and also by N-acetyl-transferases and conjugation. Atazanavir/ritonavir could potentially increase zonisamide concentrations. However since coadministration of zonisamide and ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) had no effect on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of zonisamide given to healthy subjects, this interaction is unlikely to be clinically significant.",(See Summary)
739,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Zopiclone,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Zopiclone is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8.

740,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Zotepine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Zotepine is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, and can prolong the QT interval. Coadministration may increase zotepine concentrations and thereby increase the risk of QT interval. Caution should be exercised when administering both drugs due to the risk of QT prolongation. Monitor for side effects and reduce zotepine dosage as needed.",(See Summary)
741,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Zuclopenthixol,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Zuclopenthixol is metabolized by sulphoxidation, N-dealkylation (via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) and glucuronidation. Atazanavir/ritonavir could potentially increase zuclopenthixol concentrations. Monitor side effects and reduce zuclopenthixol dosage if needed. Use with caution due to the risk of QT interval prolongation reported for both drugs.",(See Summary)
742,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Sevelamer,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Sevelamer is a resin not absorbed from the GI tract that may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. In the absence of data, when administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer. [Note: this interaction is not specific for atazanavir and ritonavir, but for any medication taken with sevelamer.]",(See Summary)

745,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Filgrastim,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Filgrastim is eliminated mainly by neutrophil-mediated clearance and renal excretion.,(See Summary)
746,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Trastuzumab emtansine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but is not recommended. Trastuzumab emtansine is a monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate. Trastuzumab does not undergo CYP mediated metabolism, however, DM1 (an active component of emtansine) is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration is not recommended due to the potential for an increase in DM1 exposure and toxicity. Consider switching to an antiretroviral regimen with no inhibitory effects on CYP3A4. If coadministration is unavoidable, consider delaying trastuzumab emtansine treatment until the antiretroviral drug is cleared from the circulation (approximately 4 elimination half-lives), if possible. If trastuzumab emtansine cannot be delayed, monitor closely for toxicity.",(See Summary)
747,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Trastuzumab,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

748,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Ascorbic acid is oxidised to dehydroascorbic acid where some is metabolised to oxalic acid and the inactive ascorbate-2-sulphate. Large doses are rapidly excreted in the urine when in excess of the requirements of the body. Atazanavir/ritonavir does not interfere with this metabolic pathway.,(See Summary)
749,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Nicotinamide (Niacinamide) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

756,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Eletriptan,Do Not Coadminister,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Eletriptan is metabolised by CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by atazanavir/ritonavir. Coadministration with ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased eletriptan Cmax and AUC by 2.7 and 5.9 fold, respectively. The US product label for eletriptan contraindicates its use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors whereas the European product label advises that it should not be used with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.",(See Summary)
757,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. Inhibition of CYP3A by atazanavir/ritonavir is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known. However, no effect of antiretroviral therapy on the response to vitamin D supplementation was found in a PK modelling study.","Pharmacokinetic modelling of vitamin D3 supplementation from 422 HIV-infected patients showed no significant differences in concentrations of 25-hydroxycolecalciferol related to antiretroviral drugs.Vitamin D3 supplementation scheme in HIV-infected patients based upon pharmacokinetic modelling of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol.

758,Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Retinol (Vitamin A) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. A clinical study demonstrated that ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir increased the activity of retinal dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV. HIV-protease inhibitors alter retinoic acid synthesis. AIDS. 2001 Oct 19;15(15):1979-84."
