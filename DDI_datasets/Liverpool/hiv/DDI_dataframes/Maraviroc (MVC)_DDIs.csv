Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) and maraviroc (300 mg twice daily) increased maraviroc AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 3.57-fold, 2.09-fold and 4.19-fold, respectively (n=12). Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and maraviroc (300 mg twice daily) to 12 subjects increased the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of maraviroc by 4.88-, 2.67-, and 6.67-fold, respectively. The recommended dose of maraviroc when coadministered with protease inhibitors (except tipranavir/ritonavir) is 150 mg twice daily. No additional maraviroc dose adjustment when coadministered with potent CYP3A inhibitors is required in patients with CrCl 30-80 mL/min. Maraviroc is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (<30 mL/min) or ESRD on regular hemodialysis who are receiving potent CYP3A inhibitors.Selzentry Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, July 2018.Coadministration of maraviroc (300 mg, twice daily) with atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir (400 mg, and 300 mg/100 mg, once daily) was studied in healthy subjects. Maraviroc Cmax and AUC increased by 209% and 357% when administered with atazanavir, and 267% and 488% when administered with atazanavir/ritonavir. The authors suggest a dose adjustment may be required.Effects of CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc in healthy volunteers. Abel S, Russell D, Taylor-Worth RJ et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2008 65(S1): 27-37.The effect of atazanavir alone (400 mg once daily) or atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc (300 mg twice daily) was studied in 12 HIV- subjects. Atazanavir alone increased maraviroc AUC by 3.6-fold and Cmax by 2.1-fold; atazanavir/ritonavir further increased maraviroc AUC (4.9-fold) and Cmax (2.7-fold). There were no significant safety or toleration issues. Maraviroc dose should be decreased to 150 mg twice daily when given with atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir. An investigation of the effects of atazanavir and ritonavir boosted atazanavir on the pharmacokinetics of the novel CCR5 inhibitor UK-427,857.

745,Maraviroc (MVC),Filgrastim,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Filgrastim is eliminated mainly by neutrophil-mediated clearance and renal excretion.,(See Summary)
746,Maraviroc (MVC),Trastuzumab,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal IgG antibody. Elimination is similar to endogenous IgG and occurs primarily via proteolytic catabolism.,(See Summary)
747,Maraviroc (MVC),Trastuzumab emtansine,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Trastuzumab emtansine is a monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate. Trastuzumab does not undergo CYP mediated metabolism, whereas DM1 (an active component of emtansine) is metabolized by CYP3A4. Maraviroc does not inhibit or induce CYPs. ",(See Summary)
748,Maraviroc (MVC),Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Ascorbic acid is oxidised to dehydroascorbic acid where some is metabolised to oxalic acid and the inactive ascorbate-2-sulphate. Large doses are rapidly excreted in the urine when in excess of the requirements of the body. There is therefore little potential for an interaction with maraviroc via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.",(See Summary)
749,Maraviroc (MVC),Phytomenadione (Vitamin K) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Metabolism of phytomenadione is thought to involve CYP4F2 and glucuronidation. Renal elimination of phytomenadione is minimal.,(See Summary)
750,Maraviroc (MVC),Nicotinamide (Niacinamide) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Nicotinamide is metabolized by nicotinamide methyltransferase to N-methylnicotinamide which is then metabolized by xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase. Renal elimination of unchanged nicotinamide is minimal.,(See Summary)
751,Maraviroc (MVC),Tocopherol (Vitamin E) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.,(See Summary)
752,Maraviroc (MVC),Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. There is little potential for an interaction with maraviroc via modulation of, or competition for, metabolic pathways.",(See Summary)
753,Maraviroc (MVC),Ferrous fumarate,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.,(See Summary)
754,Maraviroc (MVC),Iodine [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Iodine is converted to iodide, which is trapped in the thyroid gland. Iodides are excreted mainly in the urine with smaller amounts excreted in the faeces, sweat and saliva. ",(See Summary)
755,Maraviroc (MVC),Moxonidine,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Moxonidine is only minimally metabolized and is eliminated renally, mainly as unchanged moxonidine.",(See Summary)
756,Maraviroc (MVC),Thiamine (Vitamin B1) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. ,(See Summary)
757,Maraviroc (MVC),Sevelamer,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Sevelamer is a resin not absorbed from the GI tract that may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. In the absence of data, when administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer. [Note: this interaction is not specific for maraviroc, but for any medication taken with sevelamer.]",(See Summary)
758,Maraviroc (MVC),Eletriptan,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Eletriptan is metabolised by CYP3A4 and does not induce or inhibit CYPs. ,(See Summary)
759,Maraviroc (MVC),Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Cyanocobalamin undergoes enterohepatic recycling and is excreted almost entirely in the urine.,(See Summary)
760,Maraviroc (MVC),Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. ,(See Summary)
761,Maraviroc (MVC),Retinol (Vitamin A) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Vitamin A esters are hydrolysed by pancreatic enzymes to retinol, which is then absorbed and re-esterified. Some retinol is stored in the liver. Retinol not stored in the liver undergoes glucuronide conjugation and subsequent oxidation to retinal and retinoic acid.",(See Summary)
