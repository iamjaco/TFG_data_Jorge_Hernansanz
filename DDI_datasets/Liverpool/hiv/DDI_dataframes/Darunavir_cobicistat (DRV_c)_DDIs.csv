0,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Abacavir (ABC),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.,"Abacavir has also been shown in vitro not to inhibit CYP 3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Induction of hepatic metabolism has not been observed in clinical studies. Therefore, there is little potential for interactions with antiretroviral PIs.Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, December 2018.Based on the different elimination pathways of abacavir, for which metabolism is not mediated by CYP, no interactions are expected for this medicinal compound and darunavir/cobicistat. Darunavir/cobicistat can be used with this NRTI without dose adjustment.Rezolsta Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, June 2018.Clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are not anticipated with concomitant use of darunavir and cobicistat with abacavir.Prezcobix US Prescribing Information, Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, June 2018."
1,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Acamprosate,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acamprosate is eliminated unchanged in the urine.,(See Summary)
2,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Acarbose,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. After ingestion of acarbose, the majority of active unchanged drug remains in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to exert its pharmacological activity and is metabolised by intestinal enzymes and by the microbial flora.",(See Summary)
3,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Acenocoumarol,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.

4,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Acetazolamide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acetazolamide is predominantly excreted unchanged via active renal tubular secretion. Darunavir/cobicistat is unlikely to inhibit OATs at clinically relevant concentrations.,(See Summary)
5,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Aciclovir (Acyclovir),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as aciclovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1. Darunavir/cobicistat is unlikely to inhibit OATs at clinically relevant concentrations.,(See Summary)
6,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Acitretin,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but, based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as acitretin undergoes isomerisation and glucuronidation.",(See Summary)
7,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Aclidinium bromide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

9,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Adefovir,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as adefovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1. Darunavir/cobicistat is unlikely to inhibit OATs at clinically relevant concentrations.,"Cobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine. Darunavir/cobicistat should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 ml/min if any co-administered agent (e.g. adefovir dipivoxil) requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance.Rezolsta Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, June 2018."
10,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Adrenaline (Epinephrine),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

11,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),African Potato,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolic data there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. African potato was shown to inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp in vitro and to activate PXR suggesting that inhibition may occur initially followed by induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp when used for extended periods. However, coadministration of African potato with lopinavir/ritonavir in healthy volunteers did not result in significant pharmacokinetic changes suggesting that boosting by ritonavir could offset the inducing effect of African potato. Similarly, no significant effect is expected on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir/cobicistat.",(See Summary)
12,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Agomelatine,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as agomelatine is metabolised predominantly via CYP1A2.

13,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Albendazole,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 and the flavine-containing monooxygenase system are involved in the formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. Darunavir/cobicistat could potentially reduce albendazole sulfoxidation and thus lower the clinical effect of albendazole. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. ,(See Summary)
14,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Albuvirtide,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Albuvirtide is a peptide which is eliminated by catabolism to its constituent amino acids. Based on data from studies with lopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations of darunavir/cobicistat may decrease but this is not expected to be clinically relevant. Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. However, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone (lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 37%, 33% and 35%, respectively; ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 38%, 39% and 28%, respectively). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 µg/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy. Furthermore, a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study) showed that albuvirtide + lopinavir/ritonavir was non-inferior to the standard second-line regimen lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine in HIV infected Chinese individuals suggesting that this interaction has no clinical consequences. In vitro human microsomal studies indicate that albuvirtide has no inducing properties on P450 enzymes. In addition, albuvirtide binds to <1% of serum albumin in the range of clinical concentrations, thus the observed decrease in lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations is unlikely to result from protein binding displacement. However, binding of the albuvirtide-albumin complex to the HIV protease inhibitor cannot be excluded.","Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 9 HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. Conversely, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone. The mean ratios (90% CI) of AUC, Cmax and Ctrough for lopinavir were 0.63 (0.49-0.82), 0.67 (053-0.86) and 0.65 (0.46-0.91). For ritonavir, AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 0.62 (0.42-0.91), 0.61 (0.38-0.99) and 0.72 (0.40-1.26). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 ug/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy.Evaluation of pharmacokinetic interactions between long-acting HIV-1 fusion inhibitor albuvirtide and lopinavir/ritonavir, in HIV-infected subjects, combined with clinical study and simulation results.

Xenobiotica. 2017, 47(2): 133-143.The safety and efficacy of albuvirtide plus lopinavir-ritonavir in antiretroviral-experienced Chinese adults with HIV-1 was assessed in a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study). Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive albuvirtide (once weekly) plus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (albuvirtide) or WHO-recommended second-line treatment (lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine; control). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma viral load <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Non-inferiority was pre-specified with a margin of 12%. Interim analysis of 48 week data from 46 subjects in the albuvirtide group and 50 patients in the control group showed 80.4% patients in the albuvirtide group had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL versus 66.0% in the control group (difference 14.4%, 95% CI -3.0% -31.9%), meeting the non-inferiority criteria.Efficacy and safety of long-acting HIV fusion inhibitor albuvirtide in antiretroviral-experienced adults with HIV-1: interim 48-week results from the randomized, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority TALENT study.

Enhanced levodopa effects including severe diskinesias were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. A similar effect cannot be excluded with darunavir/cobicistat. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Ciclesonide can be administered with darunavir/cobicistat without dose adjustment, but with close monitoring. There is a risk of steroid side effects occurring, particularly if a high dose is used, or in case of prolonged administration, or if used with another medicine containing corticosteroids. These side effects are also more likely during periods of physiological stress. Ciclesonide is a pro-drug activated by esterases in the lungs to des-ciclesonide which then undergoes CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 7 days) with orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 µg once daily) did not alter ciclesonide but resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the AUC and a 2-fold increase in the Cmax of des-ciclesonide. Ciclesonide is mainly absorbed by the lungs, has a high protein binding and a high clearance resulting in a lower potential to cause systemic effects compared to some other inhaled corticosteroids.

149,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Clopidogrel,Do Not Coadminister,Very Low,"Coadministration of clopidogrel and boosted regimens has been evaluated in clinical studies. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite both by 69% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). In HIV-negative subjects (n=12), coadministration of clopidogrel and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 51% and 48%. Importantly, the decrease in clopidogrel’s active metabolite lead to insufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation in 44% of the patients treated with clopidogrel and ritonavir or cobicistat. Consistently, the study in HIV-negative subjects showed that the average inhibition of platelet aggregation was decreased from 51% (clopidogrel alone) to 31% (clopidogrel + ritonavir). Of interest, the study with HIV-infected patients showed a comparable decrease in prasugrel’s active metabolite AUC (52% decrease), however this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. The differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect is in line with clinical observations. Early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Taken together these data suggest that given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites. Marsousi N, Daali Y, Fontana P, et al. Clin Pharmacokinet, 2018 [epub ahead of print].The impact of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel active metabolite (AM) and the pharmacodynamic effect was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Subjects ingested either placebo or clopidogrel (300 mg followed by 75 mg the two following days) alone and together with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Ritonavir significantly decreased the exposure of clopidogrel AM by 51% and average platelet inhibition significantly decreased from 51% without ritonavir to 31% with ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -27% to -12%). The maximal platelet inhibition by clopidogrel was also reduced from 60% to 40% during concurrent ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -29% to -11%). The authors conclude that patients receiving ritonavir are at risk for diminished clopidogrel response and consequently increased risk for atherothrombotic events if the two drugs are used concurrently.

Six month later, the patient presented an episode of chest pain with electrocardiographic signs of acute anterior myocardial infarction, and evidence of thrombosis of the implanted stent.

Garlic has been shown to inhibit CYP2C9, 2C19, 3A4 in vitro but there are inconsistencies in the literature regarding the ability of garlic to modulate CYP activity in vivo (probably arising due to variations in the amount of garlic components used in different studies). Subtherapeutic trough concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir have been reported in two subjects taking darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily or 600/100 mg twice daily) with significant garlic consumption. Garlic supplements have been shown to decrease unboosted saquinavir AUC by 50% in a clinical trial and there is a case report of treatment failure due to garlic cloves (six garlic cloves three times weekly) decreasing ritonavir-boosted atazanavir trough concentrations by ~70%. Caution should be used when using garlic supplements.","Two cases of garlic and darunavir interaction have been reported. In the first case, a 27-year-old HIV positive man on tenofovir/emtricitabine (200/245 mg [sic], once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg, once daily) suffered an increase in HIV viral load. After investigation he was found to have subtherapeutic Ctroughs for darunavir and ritonavir. He reported consuming 15 cloves of garlic a week. A month after ceasing to take garlic, darunavir and ritonavir Ctroughs were in the expected range. In the second case a 41-year-old HIV positive woman on abacavir/lamivudine (600/300 mg, once daily) and darunavir and ritonavir (600/100 mg, twice daily) also experienced increased HIV viral load and subtherapeutic darunavir and ritonavir Ctroughs. She disclosed an undetermined but significant intake of garlic. Again, one month after ceasing garlic consumption, darunavir and ritonavir Ctroughs returned to expected levels. The authors hypothesise a herb-drug interaction occurred via induction of P-gp expression and activity by garlic. They state that it may be difficult to predict herb-drug interactions with garlic as the effect may depend on the preparation of garlic, estimated consumption, and time of exposure.Sub-therapeutic darunavir concentration and garlic consumption; a “Mediterranean” drug-food interaction, about 2 cases.

Enhanced levodopa effects including severe diskinesias were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. A similar effect cannot be excluded with darunavir/cobicistat. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

556,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Prasugrel,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration of prasugrel with a pharmacoenhancer has been evaluated in a clinical study. Prasugrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of prasugrel’s active metabolite by 52% and 43% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). However this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. Conversely, this same study showed that ritonavir or cobicistat significantly reduced both clopidogrel’s active metabolite exposure and inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. These data are in line with clinical observations as early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of ritonavir or cobicistat boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites.

A clinical study demonstrated that ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir increased the activity of retinal dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

Sorafenib AUC was unaffected by ritonavir coadministration, but a decreasing trend in sorafenib-N-oxide (CYP3A4 metabolite) AUC was noted. Sorafenib was poorly tolerated, and the study terminated early. The authors suggest that ritonavir may contribute to sorafenib toxicity by inhibition of CYP3A4, shunting of metabolism towards other pathways yielding more toxic metabolites that could possibly explain the toxicity observed.

747,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Retinol (Vitamin A) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. A clinical study demonstrated that ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir increased the activity of retinal dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

753,Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c),Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. Inhibition of CYP3A by darunavir/cobicistat is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known.
