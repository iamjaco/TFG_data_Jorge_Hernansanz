These findings are not considered clinically significant. Abacavir has no effect on the metabolism of ethanol.Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, December 2018.Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol. Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure. Due to their common metabolic pathways via alcohol dehydrogenase, the pharmacokinetic interaction between abacavir and ethanol was studied in 24 HIV-infected male patients. Each patient received the following treatments on separate occasions: a single 600-mg dose of abacavir, 0.7 g/kg ethanol (equivalent to 5 alcoholic drinks), and abacavir 600 mg plus 0.7 g/kg ethanol. Coadministration of ethanol and abacavir resulted in a 41% increase in abacavir AUC and a 26% increase in abacavir half life. Abacavir had no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol, so no clinically significant interaction is expected in men. This interaction has not been studied in females. Ziagen Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, June 2019.The interaction between abacavir (600 mg single dose) and ethanol (0.7g/kg single dose) was evaluated in 24 HIV-infected males. Ethanol pharmacokinetic parameters were unchanged with abacavir coadministration. There was no evidence that coadministration of abacavir interfered with ethanol metabolism and there were no disulfiram-type reactions in any subject receiving abacavir and ethanol. Abacavir AUC increased by 41% and Cmax increased by 15% and half life by 26%. While these changes were statistically significant, they were not considered clinically significant. The increased plasma abacavir concentrations observed in this study were well within the range seen in previous studies where no additional safety concerns were demonstrated.

436,Abacavir (ABC),Methadone,Potential Weak Interaction,Low,Coadministration of abacavir (600 mg twice daily) and methadone had no clinically significant effect on abacavir pharmacokinetics; methadone clearance increased by 22%. Clinical monitoring should be considered as methadone maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients.,"In a pharmacokinetic study, coadministration of 600 mg abacavir twice daily with methadone showed a 35% reduction in abacavir Cmax and a one hour delay in tmax but the AUC was unchanged. The changes in abacavir pharmacokinetics are not considered clinically relevant. In this study abacavir increased the mean methadone systemic clearance by 22%. The induction of drug metabolising enzymes cannot therefore be excluded. Patients being treated with methadone and abacavir should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal symptoms indicating under dosing, as occasionally methadone re-titration may be required. Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, December 2018.The addition of methadone has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir. In a study of 11 HIV-infected patients receiving methadone-maintenance therapy (40 mg and 90 mg daily), with 600 mg of abacavir twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased 22% (90% CI 6% to 42%). This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. The addition of methadone had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir. Ziagen Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, June 2019.Methadone concentrations were determined in 5 patients receiving methadone maintenance therapy (12.5-112.5 mg per day) before and after the introduction of amprenavir (1200 mg bd) plus abacavir (600 mg twice daily). Coadministration resulted in a 35% (28-87%) decrease in methadone concentrations. Two patients reported a withdrawal reaction to opioids. Methadone blood concentrations are decreased by the administration of abacavir plus amprenavir. Bart PA, et al. Ther Drug Monit, 2001, 23: 553-555."

While some initial data suggested HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving abacavir-containing regimens may be at risk of lower response to ribavirin therapy, this has not been confirmed in more recent studies.","Ribavirin steady state Cmin was prospectively determined in pharmacokinetic substudy on 124 HIV-HCV coinfected patients receiving ribavirin plus Peg-IFN from the ANRS CO-13 HEPAVIH cohort. Of these patients, 22% received abacavir. The overall median ribavirin Cmin was 1.6  mg/L with no statistical difference between abacavir users and non-users. There was no difference in the proportion of abacavir users versus non-users achieving RVR (respectively 59% versus 50%, p = 0.40) or EVR (72% versus 73%, p = 0.94), or in the HCV-RNA decline at week 4 or 12.

Amorosa V, Slim J, Mounzer K et al. Antivir Ther. 2010 ; 15: 91–99. In order to assess the influence of antiretrovirals on hepatitis C treatment with ribavirin and peginterferon, the outcomes of 493 HIV positive patients receiving first line treatment for hepatitis C were retrospectively analysed. Among the factors associated with lack of sustained virological response according to multivariate analysis, a trend was observed with abacavir use, which was significant in patients with lower ribavirin plasma levels (<2.3 µg/ml). Use of abacavir may interfere with anti-HCV efficacy of peginterferon and ribavirin treatment. As both ribavirin and abacavir are guanosine analogues, an inhibitory competition between both agents may explain this observation.Low response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin in HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with abacavir. Vispo E, Barreiro P, Pineda JA  Antivir Ther. 2008;13:429-37.In multivariate analysis of data from the French HC02-Ribavic Study, concomitant treatment with abacavir and pegIFN + ribavirin was associated with an adjusted 4.9 fold increase in the risk of non-response to anti-HCV therapy. Ribavirin can affect intracellular NRTI anabolite levels by inhibiting the enzyme IMP dehydrogenase and it is intriguing to speculate that alterations of carbovir triphosphate levels (the active metabolite of abacavir) may be at least part of the reason for the observed effect.

Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, October 2011.Fifteen HIV-infected patients were enrolled in a crossover-designed drug interaction trial evaluating single doses of abacavir (600 mg), lamivudine (150 mg), and zidovudine (300 mg) alone or in combination. Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine exposure (AUC decreased 15%) and zidovudine exposure (AUC increased 10%) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir. Ziagen Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, June 2019.Multiple dose pharmacokinetics were determined in HIV-infected subjects following coadministration of abacavir (200, 400 or 600 mg three times daily or 300 mg twice daily) alone or with zidovudine (200 mg three times daily or 300 mg twice daily). Coadministration of zidovudine had only small and inconsistent effects on the steady state pharmacokinetics of abacavir that did not increase with dose. At the clinical abacavir dose (300 mg twice daily), zidovudine coadministration had no effect on abacavir AUC. The pharmacokinetic profiles of zidovudine in the absence of abacavir were not determined; however, mean AUC and Cmax values for zidovudine in the presence of abacavir were comparable to historical steady state values.
