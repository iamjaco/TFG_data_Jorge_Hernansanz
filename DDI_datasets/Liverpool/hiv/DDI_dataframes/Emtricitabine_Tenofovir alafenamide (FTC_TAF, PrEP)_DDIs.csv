Large doses are rapidly excreted in the urine when in excess of the requirements of the body. Significant interactions are not expected with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide. Dose Descovy according to the concomitant antiretroviral.,(See Summary)
751,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, PrEP)",Phytomenadione (Vitamin K) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Metabolism of phytomenadione is thought to involve CYP4F2 and glucuronidation. Renal elimination of phytomenadione is minimal, therefore, there is little potential for an interaction with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide via competition for renal elimination pathways. Dose Descovy according to the concomitant antiretroviral. ",(See Summary)
752,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, PrEP)",Nicotinamide (Niacinamide) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Nicotinamide is metabolized by nicotinamide methyltransferase to N-methylnicotinamide which is then metabolized by xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase. Renal elimination of unchanged nicotinamide is minimal, therefore, there is little potential for an interaction with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide via competition for renal elimination pathways. Dose Descovy according to the concomitant antiretroviral.",(See Summary)
753,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, PrEP)",Tocopherol (Vitamin E) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Dose Descovy according to the concomitant antiretroviral. ,(See Summary)
754,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, PrEP)",Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. Significant interactions are not expected with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide. Dose Descovy according to the concomitant antiretroviral.",(See Summary)
755,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, PrEP)",Moxonidine,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Moxonidine is only minimally metabolized and is eliminated renally by glomerular filtration and active secretion, mainly as unchanged moxonidine. The renal transporter involved in moxonidine excretion is unknown but does not seem to involve P-glycoprotein or renal organic cation (OCT) transporters. No interaction is expected with emtricitabine (eliminated by OCT2) or with tenofovir alafenamide as it results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. Thus, competition for OAT1 is unlikely to cause a clinically relevant interaction with moxonidine.",(See Summary)
756,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, PrEP)",Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Dose Descovy according to the concomitant antiretroviral.,(See Summary)
757,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, PrEP)",Eletriptan,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Eletriptan is metabolised by CYP3A4 and does not induce or inhibit CYPs. Dose Descovy according to the concomitant antiretroviral.,(See Summary)
758,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, PrEP)",Sevelamer,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Sevelamer is a resin not absorbed from the GI tract that may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. In the absence of data, when administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer. [Note: this interaction is not specific for emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, but for any medication taken with sevelamer.]",(See Summary)
759,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, PrEP)",Retinol (Vitamin A) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Vitamin A esters are hydrolysed by pancreatic enzymes to retinol, which is then absorbed and re-esterified. Some retinol is stored in the liver. Retinol not stored in the liver undergoes glucuronide conjugation and subsequent oxidation to retinal and retinoic acid. Dose Descovy according to the concomitant antiretroviral. ",(See Summary)
760,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, PrEP)",Thiamine (Vitamin B1) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Dose Descovy according to the concomitant antiretroviral.,(See Summary)
761,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, PrEP)",Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Pyridoxine is absorbed from the GI tract and is converted to the active form pyridoxal phosphate. It is excreted in the urine as 4-pyridoxic acid. Dose Descovy according to the concomitant antiretroviral. ,(See Summary)
