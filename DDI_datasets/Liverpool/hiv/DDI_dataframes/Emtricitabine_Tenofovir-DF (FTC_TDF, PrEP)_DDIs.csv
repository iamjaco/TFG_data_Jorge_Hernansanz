0,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (FTC/TDF, PrEP)",Abacavir (ABC),Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration with emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF has not been studied. Based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction with emtricitabine is unlikely. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and abacavir (300 mg single dose) had no effect on abacavir AUC but Cmax increased by 12%. A similar increase in abacavir Cmax may occur with emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF. A high rate of virological failure and emergence of resistance have been reported when lamivudine was combined with tenofovir-DF and abacavir as a once daily regimen. A similar outcome is anticipated if emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF is combined with a third NRTI.,"There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early stage in HIV-1 infected patients when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well as with lamivudine and didanosine as a once daily regimen. There is close structural similarity between lamivudine and emtricitabine and similarities in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these two agents. Therefore, the same problems may be seen if Truvada is administered with a third nucleoside analogue.Truvada Summary of Product Characteristics Gilead Sciences Ltd, June 2018.Coadministration of abacavir (300 mg once daily) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) increased abacavir Cmax by 12%, but had no effect on AUC (n=8).Truvada US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, May 2018."

Based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as diclofenac is partly glucuronidated by UGT2B7 and partly oxidized by CYP2C9. However, diclofenac could potentially decrease renal elimination of tenofovir (thereby increasing the risk of nephrotoxicity) as diclofenac is a strong inhibitor of MRP4. A retrospective analysis showed that patients treated with diclofenac together with tenofovir-DF containing regimens were at higher risk of developing an acute kidney injury when compared to patients treated with tenofovir-DF-sparing regimens. Since diclofenac can exacerbate tenofovir-DF nephrotoxicity, diclofenac should be used with caution with emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF and close monitoring of renal function is recommended.","A retrospective analysis of data for patients from the Frankfurt HIV Cohort who had diclofenac prescriptions showed 89 patients with diclofenac use; 61 patients (68.5%) were treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and 28 patients (31.5%) were treated with TDF-sparing combination antiretroviral therapy.

The US product label for emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF recommends close monitoring for didanosine-associated adverse events and a reduced dose of didanosine (250 mg once daily for adults weighing 60 kg or greater with creatinine clearance 60 mL/min or greater; 200 mg once daily for adults weighing less than 60 kg with creatinine clearance 60 mL/min or greater). However, a decreased dosage of 250 mg didanosine with tenofovir-DF has been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations. Coadministration with emtricitabine has not been studied. There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at early stage when tenofovir-DF was combined with lamivudine and didanosine as a once daily regimen.

Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk for didanosine related adverse reactions. Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) didanosine. A decreased dosage of 250 mg didanosine coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

Patients receiving emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Discontinue didanosine in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis, and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving TDF with didanosine 400 mg daily. In patients weighing greater than 60 kg, reduce the didanosine dose to 250 mg when it is coadministered with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for adult or pediatric patients weighing less than 60 kg.

743,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (FTC/TDF, PrEP)",Zuclopenthixol,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Zuclopenthixol is metabolized by sulphoxidation, N-dealkylation (by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) and glucuronidation.",(See Summary)
744,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (FTC/TDF, PrEP)",Moxonidine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Moxonidine is only minimally metabolized and is eliminated renally by glomerular filtration and active secretion, mainly as unchanged moxonidine. The renal transporter involved in moxonidine excretion is unknown but does not seem to involve P-glycoprotein or renal organic cation (OCT) transporters. No interaction is expected with emtricitabine (eliminated by OCT2), however, an interaction with tenofovir-DF cannot be excluded. ",(See Summary)
745,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (FTC/TDF, PrEP)",Eletriptan,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

746,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (FTC/TDF, PrEP)",Sevelamer,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Sevelamer is a resin not absorbed from the GI tract that may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. In the absence of data, when administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer. [Note: this interaction is not specific for emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF, but for any medication taken with sevelamer.]",(See Summary)

756,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (FTC/TDF, PrEP)",Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Large doses of ascorbic acid may cause the urine to become acidic causing unexpected renal tubular reabsorption of acidic drugs, thus producing an exaggerated response. Conversely basic drugs may exhibit decreased reabsorption resulting in a decreased therapeutic effect. Emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF are predominantly eliminated unchanged via active renal tubular secretion, however unless treatment with ascorbic acid involves large doses of prolonged duration, significant interactions are not expected.",(See Summary)
757,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (FTC/TDF, PrEP)",Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. There is little potential for an interaction with emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF via modulation of, or competition for, metabolic pathways.",(See Summary)
758,"Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-DF (FTC/TDF, PrEP)",Phytomenadione (Vitamin K) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Metabolism of phytomenadione is thought to involve CYP4F2 and glucuronidation.
