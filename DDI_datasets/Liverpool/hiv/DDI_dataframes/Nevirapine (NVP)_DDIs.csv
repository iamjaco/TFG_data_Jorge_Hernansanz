13,Nevirapine (NVP),Albendazole,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. When antiepileptics (phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) were coadministered with albendazole, significantly reduced levels of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide were observed, apparently due to induction of CYP3A4. Similarly, coadministration with nevirapine could reduce albendazole exposure; however, the clinical relevance is unknown as the antihelmintic action is thought to be mainly intra-intestinal.","Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital appear to induce the oxidative metabolism of albendazole via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A by roughly the same extent, resulting in significantly reduced concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide. This interaction is likely to be clinically significant when albendazole is used to treat systemic worm infections, and increased doses of albendazole would be needed. The interaction is probably not clinically significant when albendazole is used for intestinal worm infections. Lanchote VL, et al.

Nevirapine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. In vitro human microsomal studies and limited in vivo drug-drug interaction data indicate that albuvirtide has no inhibiting or inducing properties on P450 enzymes.

This may negatively impact the effectiveness of artesunate/amodiaquine in patients receiving nevirapine. The mechanism for this interaction is unclear as nevirapine is not thought to inhibit CYP2C8 in the range of clinical concentrations. In addition, coadministration of these drugs may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity through additive toxicity. Careful clinical monitoring for efficacy and toxicity is recommended.","The effect of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily with zidovudine/lamivudine) on the pharmacokinetics of amodiaquine (600 mg once daily, administered with artesunate 200 mg once daily) were determined in two groups of HIV+ subjects (NVP n=10; control n=11). Exposures to both amodiaquine and its active metabolite desethylamodiaquine were significantly lower in the nevirapine group with AUCs of amodiaquine and its active metabolite decreasing by 29% and 33%.

The effect on nevirapine pharmacokinetics was not significant. Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.The influence of nevirapine on atazanavir trough concentrations (Ctrough) was studied in a group of HIV-infected patients (n=11) receiving 300/100 mg atazanavir/ritonavir once daily for 2 weeks or longer. Nevirapine was added at a dose of 200 mg once daily from Days 0 to 14 and 200 mg twice daily from Days 14 to 28. Atazanavir and nevirapine plasma Ctroughs were determined at Days 0 and 28. The geometric mean atazanavir Ctrough decreased from 0.631 mg/L (range, 0.235-1.87 mg/L) at Day 0 to 0.316 mg/L (range, 0.142-1.109 mg/L) at Day 28 to give a geometric mean ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.38-0.80; P = 0.026); nonetheless, the atazanavir Ctrough remained higher than the minimum effective concentration in 80% of the participants and higher than the median concentration in historical control subjects receiving 400 mg atazanavir once daily without ritonavir (GMR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.65-6.22; P = 0.001). The authors conclude that monitoring atazanavir Ctrough is recommended in patients treated with this drug combination, and increasing the atazanavir dose might be necessary. Effect of nevirapine on the steady-state trough concentrations of atazanavir in HIV-infected patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir. Molto J, Deig E, Valle M, et al. Ther Drug Monit, 2010, 32(1): 93-96.Trough concentrations were obtained from 16 patients receiving nevirapine once daily (400 mg) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg, n=7; 400/100 mg n=9). Median atazanavir trough concentrations were 340 ng/ml and 520 ng/ml for the 300 mg and 400 mg groups, respectively; values obtained from historical controls receiving 300/100 mg were 610 ng/ml. Nevirapine trough concentrations were 3900 ng/ml and 4000 ng/ml for the two groups and were comparable to literature values for patients treated with nevirapine alone (3700 ng/ml). Given the decrease in atazanavir trough concentrations, relative to historical controls, therapeutic drug monitoring of atazanavir may be appropriate for patients (especially if treatment experienced) receiving this combination. Plasma concentrations of atazanavir in HIV patients treated with regimens including nevirapine. Kurowski M, et al. 8th International Congress on Drug Therapy in HIV Infection, Glasgow, November 2006, abstract 276.Steady-state atazanavir concentrations were assessed in HIV+ patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with and without tenofovir and/or nevirapine. No significant difference was observed in atazanavir concentrations for patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir alone and those taking tenofovir. There was a trend towards decreased atazanavir concentrations for patients co-dosed with nevirapine (with or without tenofovir).

Sekar V, Lefebvre E, Marien K, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2009, 68(1): 116-119.Data from TDM and a population PK approach were used to examine the influence of coadministered drugs on nevirapine pharmacokinetics in a cohort of 51 patients. In the final one compartment model there was relationship between nevirapine clearance and the presence of darunavir in the regimen. There was a significant decrease in clearance (CL/f, 3.84 ± 0.92 vs 2.76 ± 1.00 L/h) and an increase in the mean nevirapine trough plasma concentrations (3.68 ± 1.69 vs 5.35 ± 3.20 mg/L) in combination with darunavir. The limitations of the study are that it is TDM data and small numbers. The advantage is that these are results obtained with the recommended twice daily dose of darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg) rather than the lower doses (300/100 or 400/100 mg) used in the early interaction studies.Influence of darunavir coadministration on nevirapine pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected patients: a population approach.

346,Nevirapine (NVP),Ifosfamide,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of nevirapine via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Pretreatment with the CYP3A inducer dexamethasone proportionally decreased the AUC for both ifosfamide metabolites. induction of CYP2B enzymes by high-dose phenobarbital pretreatment significantly decreased the fraction of ifosfamide undergoing 4-hydroxylation from 37% to 22% of total metabolism. As nevirapine is an enzyme inducer, there is potential for ifosfamide levels to be reduced if coadministered.","The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites.

In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely.

In vitro data indicate that imatinib inhibits CYPs 3A4, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. Nevirapine could potentially decrease imatinib exposure (induction of CYP3A4), potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. The US Prescribing Information suggests considering alternative therapeutic agents with less enzyme induction potential when CYP3A4 inducers are indicated. Imatinib may increase exposure of CYP3A4 substrates, such as nevirapine.","Substances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity may significantly reduce exposure to imatinib, potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. Pre-treatment with multiple doses of rifampicin 600 mg followed by a single 400 mg dose of imatinib resulted in decrease in Cmax and AUC by at least 54% and 74%, of the respective values without rifampicin treatment. Similar results were observed in patients with malignant gliomas treated with imatinib while taking enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) such as carbazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin. The plasma AUC for imatinib decreased by 73% compared to patients not on EIAEDs. Concomitant use of rifampicin or other strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be avoided. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolised drugs.Glivec Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, October 2012.Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with multiple doses of rifampin followed by a single dose of imatinib, increased imatinib oral-dose clearance by 3.8-fold, which significantly (p<0.05) decreased mean Cmax and AUC. Similar findings were observed in patients receiving 400-1200 mg/day imatinib concomitantly with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED) (e.g., carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone). The mean dose normalized AUC for imatinib in the patients receiving EIAED’s decreased by 73% compared to patients not receiving EIAED. Concomitant administration of imatinib and St. John’s Wort led to a 30% reduction in the AUC of imatinib. Consider alternative therapeutic agents with less enzyme induction potential in patients when rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers are indicated. Imatinib doses up to 1200 mg/day (600 mg BID) have been given to patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib.

The Kaletra tablets dosage should be increased to 500/125 mg twice daily when coadministered with nevirapine. KALETRA ORAL SOLUTION: No change in the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir was apparent in healthy volunteers during nevirapine and Kaletra co-administration. Results from a study in HIV-positive paediatric patients revealed a decrease in lopinavir concentrations during nevirapine co-administration. The effect of nevirapine in HIV-positive adults is expected to be similar to that in paediatric patients and lopinavir concentrations may be decreased. The clinical significance of the pharmacokinetic interaction is unknown. No formal recommendation could be drawn on dosage adjustment when Kaletra is used in combination with nevirapine. However, based on clinical experience, Kaletra dose increase to 533/133 mg twice daily may be considered when co-administered with nevirapine, particularly for patients in whom reduced lopinavir susceptibility is likely.Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012.Kaletra tablets and oral solution should not be administered as a ONCE DAILY regimen in combination with nevirapine. A dose increase is recommended for all patients who use Kaletra tablets or oral solution in combination with nevirapine.

Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, June 2008.Coadministration of nevirapine and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) decreased lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 27%, 19% and 46%, respectively. An increase in the dose of lopinavir/ritonavir to 533/133 mg (4 capsules) or 500/125 mg (5 tablets with 100/25 mg each) twice daily with food is recommended in combination with nevirapine. Dose adjustment of nevirapine is not required when co-administered with lopinavir. Coadministration of nevirapine and lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution (300/75 mg/m2) to paediatric patients decreased lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 22%, 14% and 55%, respectively. For children, increase of the dose of lopinavir/ritonavir to 300/75 mg/m2 twice daily with food should be considered when used in combination with nevirapine, particularly for children in whom reduced susceptibility to lopinavir/ritonavir is suspected. Viramune Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, January 2012.Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with Kaletra (400/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily) in 22 patients was compared to lopinavir/ritonavir alone in 19 patients. Patients taking nevirapine had 27%, 19% and 51% lower lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively. The effect on nevirapine pharmacokinetics was not significant. A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets to 500/125 mg twice-daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution to 533/133 mg twice daily with food is recommended in combination with nevirapine.Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.The aim of this study was to assess the influence of nevirapine on lopinavir pharmacokinetics in order to optimise dosing regimens. The study included 15 HIV+ subjects, who received LPV/r (533/133 mg twice daily) and NVP (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks followed by NVP 200 mg twice daily). Steady state pharmacokinetic parameters were measured at week 4 and compared with data from patients (n=23) receiving LPV/r (400/100 mg twice daily) + 2 NRTIs. Following an increase in the LPV/r dosage, the mean ± sd LPV Ctrough was 5240 ± 4029 ng/ml, which was not significantly different from the mean Ctrough for LPV 400/100 mg bid + 2NRTI (4272 ± 3114 ng/ml, P=0.637). No statistically significant difference was observed in the mean AUC for LPV 400/100 mg bid + 2NRTI or with LPV/r 533/133 mg bid + NVP 200 mg bid (82746 ± 41019 vs 100940 ± 48871 ng.h/ml, P=0.3286). The findings suggest that an increase in LPV/r dose to 533/133 mg (4 capsules twice daily) is appropriate when co-administered with NVP. Data is awaited on the new tablet formulation of lopinavir in the presence of nevirapine.

Youle M, et al. 16th International AIDS Conference, Toronto, August 2006, abstract TUPE0094.Coadministration of an NNRTI (n=25; nevirapine n=9, efavirenz n=16) with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) resulted in a 39% decrease in lopinavir Ctrough but no change in Cmax, compared in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily alone n=125). There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking efavirenz and nevirapine. There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=125) and those taking lopinavir/ritonavir (533/133 mg twice daily, n=32) with an NNRTI (NVP n=3, EFV n=29). There was no statistically significant difference in ritonavir Ctrough or Cmax in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily with or without an NNRTI but patients taking lopinavir ritonavir 533/133 mg twice daily with an NNRTI had higher ritonavir Ctrough and Cmax. The number of patients with lopinavir concentrations below the 3000 ng/ml threshold was higher in those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 with an NNRTI compared to those without an NNRTI. However, the number of patients with suboptimal levels was comparable between those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg alone to those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg plus an NNRTI. Similar results were observed when a lower threshold (1500 ng/ml) was used. Therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir/ritonavir given alone or with an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Solas C, Poizot-Martin I, Drogoul M, et al., Br J Pharmacol, 2003, 57: 436-440.The coadministration of nevirapine to 2 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in lopinavir Cmin values of 1420 and 5240 ng/ml and Cmax values of 3920 and 12300 ng/ml. Mean lopinavir concentrations in a group of patients (n=4) receiving lopinavir/ritonavir alone were 5690 (1420-11120) ng/ml for Cmin and 12400 (3920-17300) ng/ml for Cmax.

Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with methadone (racemic n=11; (R)-methadone n=9) significantly decreased the methadone mean dose-adjusted AUC by 41%. AUC reductions were similar in patients taking the racemic methadone (37%) or the R-enantiomer (44%). 14/20 patients required additional methadone due to withdrawal symptoms. However, the median dose increase (15%) was less than that which would be expected from the PK data. Nevirapine significantly reduces the levels of racemic methadone and (R)-methadone in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.

Coadministration of nevirapine and rifampicin (600 mg once daily) increased rifampicin AUC and Cmax by 11% and 6%, respectively. In contrast, rifampicin produced a significant lowering of nevirapine AUC (58% decrease), Cmax (50% decrease) and Cmin (68% decrease) compared to historical controls. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine containing regimen may consider use of rifabutin instead. Viramune Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, January 2012.Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with rifampicin (600 mg once daily) in 14 HIV+ patients caused an 11% increase in rifampicin AUC but no alteration in Cmax. Rifampicin Cmin was below the limit of detection for the assay. Administration of rifampicin had a clinically significant effect on nevirapine pharmacokinetics, decreasing AUC and Cmax by greater than 50%. Nevirapine and rifampicin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with TB and using a nevirapine containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.Participants were randomly selected to receive either nevirapine at 200 mg twice daily (n=256) or efavirenz at 600 mg daily (n=270), combined with two nucleoside analogues. Sixteen participants participated in an extensive pharmacokinetic study of nevirapine. Nevirapine concentrations at the end of the first week of treatment (on antituberculosis drugs) did not differ from concentrations off tuberculosis treatment, but declined thereafter. Concentrations at steady-state were 4111 ng/mL at week 12 versus 6095 ng/mL at week 48 (P < 0.0001). Nevirapine concentrations <3000 ng/mL were found to be a risk factor for virological failure. Efavirenz concentrations were higher on than off tuberculosis treatment (2700 versus 2450 ng/mL, P<0.0001). The omission of the 2 week lead-in dose of nevirapine prevented low concentrations at treatment initiation but did not prevent the risk of virological failure. Nevirapine or efavirenz for tuberculosis and HIV coinfected patients: exposure and virological failure relationship. Bhatt NB, Baudin E, Meggi B, et al. J Antimicrob Chemother, 2015, 70:225-232.Patients with HIV-1 and TB were randomized to two different once-daily antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens along with anti-TB treatment. In the NVP arm, 29% of patients had an unfavourable outcome at 6 months compared to 9% in EFV arm (P<0.08). The mean NVP and EFV levels estimated at 1 and 6 months did not significantly differ between favourable and unfavourable responders. Logistic regression analysis showed CYP2B6 516G>T polymorphism significantly associated with virologic outcome in patients receiving EFV-based regimen. Trough plasma concentrations of NVP and EFV did not show any association with response to ART in patients on anti-TB treatment and once-daily ART. CYP2B6 516G>T polymorphism was associated with virologic outcome among patients on EFV. Lack of association between plasma levels of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors & virological outcomes during rifampicin co-administration in HIV-infected TB patients. Ramachandran G, Kumar AK, Ponnuraja C, et al. Indian J Med Res, 2013, 138:955-961.A randomised open label trial was conducted in ART naive HIV-TB patients, randomly assigned to receive either nevirapine or efavirenz based ART with concomitant rifampicin based anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). Participants were followed for 24 months. Of the 135 HIV-TB patients, who were receiving rifampicin based ATT, 68 were selected randomly to receive efavirenz based ART and 67 to receive nevirapine based ART. The virological failure rates in the overall population, and the nevirapine and efavirenz groups were 14.1% (19/135); 14.9% (10/67) and 13.2% (9/68), respectively (p =0.94). No significant difference was found between the groups in the rate of clinical, immunological or virological failures. The overall mortality was 17% with no significant difference between the two groups. Except for the lead in period on day 14, the mean nevirapine concentration remained above 3 mg/L. No association was found between plasma levels of nevirapine and incidence of unfavourable outcomes in this group. Outcome of ART in HIV-TB patients on rifampicin based ATT showed no significant difference, irrespective of whether efavirenz or nevirapine was used. Therefore, nevirapine based ART could be an alternative in the resource limited settings in patients with HIV and tuberculosis co-infection. Nevirapine versus efavirenz-based antitretroviral therapy regimens in antiretroviral-naïve patients with HIV and tuberculosis infection in India: a pilot study. Sinha S, Raghunandan P, Chandrashekhar R, et al. BMC Infect Dis, 2013, 13:482.ARV-naïve HIV-infected TB patients were initiated on an intermittent short-course regimen and randomized to receive didanosine and lamivudine with either NVP (400 mg) or EFV (600 mg) once-daily. Of the 168 patients included (79% men, median CD4 count 93 cells/mm3, median viral load 242,000 copies/ml), 104 were on EFV-based ART and 64 on NVP-based ART. There was a small but statistically significant elevation in ALT and SAP at 2 weeks and AST at 6 weeks after ART initiation. The proportion of patients with rate-limiting toxicity of liver enzymes was small. None had treatment terminated because of hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity is not a major concern when HIV-infected TB patients, with normal baseline liver function initiate treatment for both infections simultaneously. Early changes in hepatic function among HIV-tuberculosis patients treated with nevirapine or efavirenz along with rifampin-based anti-tuberculosis therapy.

Nevirapine pharmacokinetics were compared with those in 16 children aged less than 3 years without tuberculosis. Twenty-two children were treated for HIV/TB coinfection, 10 of whom were girls. One boy was excluded from analysis for nonadherence. The nevirapine AUC up to 12 h was estimated as 52.0 mg.h/L (range: 22.6-159.7) compared with 90.9 mg.h/L (range: 40.4-232.1) in children without tuberculosis (P < 0.001). Predose concentrations of nevirapine were less than 3.0 mg/L in 11 children on tuberculosis treatment versus none of the 16 children without tuberculosis treatment (P=0.001).

The median age (range) was 9.7 (4.4-11.7) years. The nevirapine area under the concentration versus time curve from 0 to 12 hours and trough concentration with rifampicin were 85.3 (40.5-170.7) mg.h/mL and 6.4 (3.00-13.27) mg/mL, respectively, providing adequate exposure. Pharmacokinetics of nevirapine in HIV and tuberculosis-coinfected children receiving antiretroviral fixed-dose combination tablets while receiving rifampicin-containing tuberculosis treatment and after rifampicin discontinuation. Prasitsuebsai W, Cressey TR, Capparelli E, et al. Pediatr Infect Dis, 2012, 31:389-391.Coadministration of nevirapine-containing HAART and rifampicin-containing ATT was assessed in 63 antiretroviral treatment naïve HIV/TB co-infected patients with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3 who were started on rifampicin-containing ATT followed by nevirapine-containing HAART. A control group including 51 HIV patients without tuberculosis and on nevirapine-containing HAART was assessed. 97 out of 114 (85.1%) patients were alive at the end of 48 weeks. The CD4 cell count showed a mean increase of 108 vs.113 cells/mm3 (p=0.83) at 24 weeks of HAART in cases and controls respectively. Overall, 58.73% patients in cases had viral loads <400 copies/ml at the end of 48 weeks. The mean (± SD) Nevirapine concentrations of cases and control at 14, 28, 42 and 180 days were 2.19 ± 1.49 vs. 3.27 ± 4.95 (p=0.10), 2.78 ± 1.60 vs. 3.67 ± 3.59 (p=0.08), 3.06 ± 3.32 vs. 4.04 ± 2.55 (p=0.10) respectively and 3.04 μg/ml (in cases). Good immunological and clinical response can be obtained in HIV/TB co-infected patients receiving rifampicin and nevirapine concomitantly despite somewhat lower nevirapine trough concentrations. This suggests that rifampicin-containing ATT may be co administered in resource limited setting with nevirapine-containing HAART regimen without substantial reduction in antiretroviral effectiveness. The antiretroviral efficacy of highly active antiretroviral therapy and plasma nevirapine concentrations in HIV-TB-co-infected Indian patients receiving rifampicin based antituberculosis treatment. Sinha S, Dhooria S, Kumar S, et al. AIDS Res Ther, 2011, 8:41.A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted at 3 sites in southern India. HIV-infected patients with TB were treated with a standard short-course anti-TB regimen (2 months of ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide / 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin) thrice weekly, and randomized to receive once-daily EFV at a dose of 600 mg or NVP at a dose of 400 mg (after 14 days of 200 mg administered once daily) with didanosine 250/400 mg and lamivudine 300 mg after 2 months. A total of 116 patients (75% [87 patients] of whom had pulmonary TB), with a mean age of 36 years, a median CD4+ cell count of 84 cells/mm(3), and a median viral load of 310 000 copies/mL, were randomized. At 24 weeks, 50 of 59 patients in the EFV group and 37 of 57 patients in the NVP group had virological suppression (P=0.024). There were no deaths, 1 SAE, and 5 treatment failures in the EFV arm, compared with 5 deaths, 2 SAEs, and 10 treatment failures in the NVP arm. The trial was halted by the data and safety monitoring board at the second interim analysis. Favorable TB treatment outcomes were observed in 93% of the patients in the EFV arm and 84% of the patients in the NVP arm (P=.058). Compared with a regimen of didanosine, lamivudine, and EFV, a regimen of once-daily didanosine, lamivudine, and NVP was inferior and was associated with more frequent virologic failure and death. Efficacy and safety of once-daily nevirapine- or efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy in HIV-associated tuberculosis: a randomized clinical trial.

Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health, 2011, 42:651-658.A cross-sectional study was conducted in 30 HIV infected children on ART with nevirapine or efavirenz. Patients on simultaneous rifampicin and nevirapine were given higher doses of nevirapine with regular monitoring of liver function tests. Thirty patients (14 males) were enrolled in the study with 20 on nevirapine and 10 (33.3%) on efavirenz. Seven (23.3%) patients were simultaneously taking rifampicin. The mean nevirapine dose given to the patients was 350.9±59.8 mg/m2/day (on simultaneous rifampicin) and 309.2±54.6 mg/m2/day (not on concurrent rifampicin). Thirteen (81.3%) of the 16 patients with trough nevirapine had values in the normal range, 1 (6.3%) had low nevirapine trough levels and 2 (12.5%) had high nevirapine trough levels. Of the post 2 hours nevirapine levels, 1 (5%) had low levels and 3 (15%) had high nevirapine blood levels. All the five patients being given concurrent rifampicin had normal trough and post 2 hours levels of nevirapine. The efavirenz drug levels were 1.9±1.1 g/mL. Concurrent rifampicin administration does not alter blood levels of nevirapine; provided the dose of nevirapine is increased by 20-30%. Serum nevirapine and efavirenz concentrations and effect of concomitant rifampicin in HIV infected children on antiretroviral therapy. Shah I, Swaminathan S, Ramachandran G, et al. Indian Pediatr, 2011, 48:943-947.HIV-1/TB  co-infected Ugandan adults (n=18) receiving rifampicin daily as part of anti-tuberculosis therapy were evenly randomized to nevirapine initiation by dose escalation (NVP200) or nevirapine initiation at 200 mg twice daily (NVP400). Day 7 geometric mean nevirapine C12 [90% confidence interval (CI)] was 1504 (1127-2115) ng/mL and 3148 (2451-4687) ng/mL in the NVP200 and NVP400 arms, respectively (P < 0.01). Nevirapine C12 on Days 14 and 21 was similar. On Day 21, nevirapine concentration in 64% of patients was below the MEC. On Day 7, geometric mean AUC was lower in the NVP200 arm, 25 223 (90% CI, 21 978-29 695) ng•h/mL versus 43 195 (35 607-57 035) ng•h/mL in the NVP400 arm (P < 0.01). Similarly, on Day 14, nevirapine AUC was lower in the NVP200 arm 23 668 (18 253-32 218) ng•h/mL versus the NVP400 arm 44 918 (36 264-62 769) ng•h/mL (P = 0.03). In co-treated patients, nevirapine concentrations were below the MEC during initiation with dose escalation. Nevirapine initiation at the maintenance dose of 200 mg twice daily is preferred. Sub-therapeutic nevirapine concentrations were common at Day 21 with either regimen.

All were followed through 4 years of ART. Thirty-nine (55.7%) patients in the TB group were diagnosed with extrapulmonary/disseminated TB. The median duration of concurrent administration of nevirapine and rifampin was 5.4 (4.6-6.1) months. By intention-to-treat analysis, the percentage of patients who achieved HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml was 52.9% in the TB group and 50% in control group (p=0.866; odds ratio 1.121, 95% confidence interval 0.578-2.176); median (IQR) CD4 counts were 352 (271-580) cells/mm3 and 425 (308-615) cells/mm3 in the corresponding groups (p=0.238). The proportion of ART discontinuation due to any reason at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years was 21%, 34%, 37%, and 46% in the TB group and 21%, 36%, 43%, and 49% in the control group, respectively (p=0.651). The 4-year mortality rate was 6.4% in both groups.

Seventy-four per cent of patients who completed TB treatment and had a viral load performed (n=74) had undetectable levels (<50 copies/ml), while 17 (22%) had a viral load of 50-1000 copies/ml. Hepatotoxicity was present in 2 (1.3%) patients at baseline. Two patients developed Grade 2 and one developed Grade 3 alanine transaminase enzyme elevations during TB treatment (incidence rate per 10 years of follow-up 4.2, 95%CI 1.4-13.1). There were no reported deaths linked to hepatotoxicity. In a rural district in Malawi, concomitant NVP and RMP treatment is associated with good TB treatment outcomes and appears safe. Further follow-up of patients would be useful to ascertain the longer-term effects of this concurrent treatment. Outcomes and safety of concomitant nevirapine and rifampicin treatment under programme conditions in Malawi. Moses M, Zachariah R, Tayler-Smith K, et al. Int J Tuberc Lung Dis, 2010, 14:197-202.The pharmacokinetics of nevirapine were investigated in HIV/TB-coinfected subjects receiving rifampicin who were randomised to start nevirapine with dose escalation (200 mg once daily for 14 days and then 200 mg twice daily) or at full dose (200 mg twice daily). Nevirapine trough concentrations were below target (3000 ng/ml) in the escalation arm at Days 7, 14 and 21. In the full dose arm, Day 7 trough concentrations were above target, but steady state trough concentrations (Days 14 and 21) were below target. This study raises two questions, i) is the commonly used target of 3000 ng/ml appropriate for Ugandan patients, and ii) should a higher dose of nevirapine (e.g. 600 mg daily) be considered after the first 14 days. Nevirapine pharmacokinetics when initiated at 200 mg or 400 mg daily in HIV-1 and tuberculosis Co-infected Ugandan adults on rifampicin. Lamorde M, et al. 17th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, San Francisco, February 2010, abstract 602.HIV-1-infected patients with CD4+ count ≤100 cells/ml and TB diagnosis received standard anti-TB therapy and a fixed-dose combination of stavudine, lamivudine, and NVP. In 16 enrolled subjects, the median value of the area under the curve of NVP was reduced by 25.6% at T1 compared with NVP alone (43.7 vs. 58.7 µg/ml.h; P=0.02). The reduction was only 7.5% at T2 (54.3 vs. 58.7 µg/ml.h; P=0.17). The median C trough was reduced of 19.5% at T1 compared with T3 (3.3 vs. 4.2 µg/mL; P=0.02) and of 7.1% at T2 compared with T3 (3.9 vs. 4.2 µg/mL; P=0.17). The proportion of subjects with C trough values <or=3 µg/mL was 31.2% (5 of 16), 40.0% (6 of 15), and 7.7% (1 of 13) at T1, T2, and T3, respectively. The reduction of the area under the curve of NVP during concomitant RFM treatment substantially decreases over time. Reversible reduction of nevirapine plasma concentrations during rifampicin treatment in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and tuberculosis. Matteelli A, Saleri N, Villani P, et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2009, 52:64-69.Patients were divided into two groups: (1) patients receiving nevirapine-containing antiretroviral regimen (200 mg twice daily) and continuation phase rifampicin-containing tuberculosis therapy (n=27); (2) patients without tuberculosis who were receiving a nevirapine-containing antiretroviral regimen for at least 3 weeks (n=26). The population pharmacokinetics of nevirapine was described using nonlinear mixed effects modelling with NONMEM software. Based on the developed model, plasma concentration profiles after 300, 400 and 500 mg of nevirapine twice daily were simulated. Concomitant administration of rifampicin increased nevirapine oral clearance (CL/F) by 37.4% and reduced the absorption rate constant (k(a)) by almost sixfold. Rifampicin reduced the nevirapine average minimum concentration by 39%. Simulated doses of 300 mg twice daily elevated nevirapine concentrations above subtherapeutic levels in most patients, with minimum exposure above the recommended maximum concentration. The area under the concentration-time curve of 12-hydroxynevirapine was not different in the presence of rifampicin. 2-, 3- and 8-Hydroxynevirapine were not detectable (LLOQ=0.025 mg/L). The simulations suggest that an increased dose of 300 mg twice daily would achieve adequate nevirapine concentrations in most patients during rifampicin-containing treatment for tuberculosis. Population pharmacokinetics of nevirapine in combination with rifampicin-based short course chemotherapy in HIV- and tuberculosis-infected South African patients. Elsherbiny D, Cohen K, Jansson B, et al. Eur J Clin Pharmacol, 2009, 65:71-80.The pharmacokinetics of nevirapine when started at full dose (200 mg twice daily, with no dose escalation) was studied in TB/HIV+ subjects receiving rifampicin. Nevirapine trough concentrations (mean ± sd) two weeks after commencing nevirapine were 5.83 ±2.29 mg/L. Pharmacokinetic profiles were determined during rifampicin dosing 4 weeks after commencing nevirapine, and 4 weeks after completion of rifampicin dosing. Nevirapine Cmin, Cmax and AUC increased by 14%, 13% and 20%, respectively, in the absence of rifampicin (Cmin 4.86 vs 5.74 mg/L; Cmax 6.86 vs 7.77 mg/L; AUC 70.05 vs 80.03 h.mg/L). When nevirapine was started at full dose in patients receiving rifampicin, therapeutic nevirapine concentrations (>3 mg/L) were attained and there was a potent decline in viral load. Pharmacokinetic parameters of nevirapine when initiated without 2-weeks leading dose in tuberculosis-HIV co-infected patients receiving rifampicin: substudy of the CARINEMO-ANRS 12146 trial in Maputo (Mozambique). Bonnet M, Bhatt NB, Jani IV, et al. 5th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention, Cape Town, July 2009, abstract WEPEB253.Data from the Liverpool Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) registry were linked with the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (CHIC) Study. For each patient, the first measurement of efavirenz (600 or 800 mg/day) or nevirapine (400 mg/day) plasma concentration was included. Linear regression was used to evaluate the association of dose, gender, age, weight, ethnicity and concomitant antiretroviral drugs or rifampicin with log-transformed drug concentration, adjusted for time since last intake. Data from 339 patients on efavirenz (34% black, 17% rifampicin) and 179 on nevirapine (27% black, 6% rifampicin) were included. Multivariable models revealed the following predictors for efavirenz concentration: black ethnicity (59% higher; P<0.001), weight (10% lower per additional 10 kg; P=0.002), 800 mg/day (52% higher; P=0.027), rifampicin (35% lower; P=0.039), and zidovudine (25% lower; P=0.010). For nevirapine the predictors were black ethnicity (39% higher; P=0.002), rifampicin (40% lower; P=0.002), protease inhibitor (28% higher; P=0.008) and tenofovir (22% higher; P=0.024). Our analyses confirm that concomitant rifampicin substantially decreases concentration of both efavirenz and nevirapine. Factors influencing efavirenz and nevirapine plasma concentration: effect of ethnicity, weight and co-medication. Stohr W, Back D, Dunn D, et al. Antivir Ther, 2008, 13:675-685.Patients starting ART with or without concurrent antitubercular therapy received either efavirenz or nevirapine at standard doses. Patients developing tuberculosis while taking antiretroviral therapy that included nevirapine were either changed to efavirenz or continued taking nevirapine. The analysis included 2035 individuals who started antiretroviral therapy with efavirenz (1074 with concurrent tuberculosis) and 1935 with nevirapine (209 with concurrent tuberculosis). There were no differences in time to death or substitution of either antiretroviral drug for toxicity with and without concurrent tuberculosis. Patients starting nevirapine with concurrent tuberculosis were at a higher risk of elevated viral load most notably at 6 months (16.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.6%-23.5%) than those without tuberculosis (8.3%; 95% CI, 6.7%-10.0%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.4; and in the combined estimate, adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.6). In the time-to-event analysis of confirmed virological failure (2 consecutive values of > or=5000 copies/mL), patients starting nevirapine with concurrent tuberculosis developed virological failure sooner (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.7). There was no difference in time to virological rebound in patients free of tuberculosis and those developing tuberculosis during follow-up while taking nevirapine (adjusted HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.5-2.0. Virological outcomes were inferior when nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy was commenced while taking antitubercular treatment. Outcomes of nevirapine- and efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy when coadministered with rifampicin-based antitubercular therapy. Boulle A, Van Cutsem G, Cohen K, et al. JAMA, 2008, 300, 530-539.Thirty-two HIV-infected adults with CD4+ T-cell counts <200 cells/mm3 and active TB, receiving rifampicin for 2-6 weeks were randomized to receive either NVP 400 mg (NVP400) or 600 mg (NVP600) per day plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; a 2-week NVP lead-in was performed at 200 mg once daily (OD) and 200 mg twice daily, respectively. From week 4, 12 h PK studies showed that NVP400 had lower median NVP AUC0-12 h, Cmax and C12 than NVP600 (P<0.05). Four patients in NVP600 developed NVP hypersensitivity. At week 48, the median CD4+ T-cell count rise and proportion with viral load <50 copies/ml (intention-to-treat analysis 56% versus 50% and as-treated analysis 75% versus 89%) were comparable. In rifampicin-treated patients, 200 mg NVP OD lead-in led to a significant short-term suboptimal NVP C12 level, while NVP 400 mg lead-in then 600 mg/day was associated with a high rate of NVP hypersensitivity. Forty-eight week efficacy was comparable. Thus, NVP 600 mg/day in rifampicin-treated patients is not recommended. Pharmacokinetics and 48-weel efficacy of nevirapine: 400 mg versus 600 mg per day in HIV-tuberculosis coinfection receiving rifampicin. Avihingsanon A, Manosuthi W, Kantipong P, et al. Antivir Ther, 2008, 13:529-536.Single center prospective data were collected on all TB/HIV-coinfected patients who received concomitant NNRTI and rifampicin. Of 103 TB/HIV coinfected patients, 26 received concomitant rifampicin with efavirenz (EFV) and 17 with nevirapine (NVP). NNRTIs were commenced after rifampicin in 18/26 (69%) and 7/17 (41%) subjects treated with EFV and NVP, respectively. Of these 88% completed antituberculosis therapy. There were two (5%) deaths, both due to lymphoproliferative malignancy. Three (7%) patients transferred care or discontinued therapy. Of subjects 83% had normal liver function tests (LFTs) and 11% had Grade 1-2 and 6% Grade 3-4 LFT abnormalities during concomitant therapy. Plasma concentrations were measured in 31 patients. The first were within the therapeutic range in 5/7 on NVP 200 mg twice daily, 2/4 on NVP 300 mg twice daily, 3/7 EFV 600 mg once daily, and 7/13 on EFV 800 mg once daily. Concentrations were subtherapeutic in 4/11 (36%) and 3/20 (20%) subjects on NVP and EFV, respectively. No virological rebounds were observed. Of subjects receiving concomitant NVP or EFV with rifampicin, 64% and 80%, respectively, had therapeutic NNRTI plasma concentrations. Subtherapeutic concentrations were not associated with virological failure. Good clinical outcomes and a low incidence of hepatotoxicity were observed. Concomitant use of nonnucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors and rifampicin in TB/HIV type 1-coinfected patients. Sathia L, Obiorah I, Taylor G, et al. AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses, 2008, 24:897-901.A retrospective cohort study was conducted in all ART-naïve patients who were receiving rifampicin. Of 188 patients, 77 and 111 patients were initiated on EFV-based ART (EFV group) and NVP-based ART (NVP group), respectively. At 48 weeks, 77.9% (60/77) in the EFV group and 67.6% (75/111) in the NVP group achieved HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL (P=0.140, odds ratio=0.590, 95% confidence interval=0.302-1.153). At 24 and 48 weeks, respective median CD4 counts were 174 and 254 cells/muL in the EFV group and 156 and 218 cells/microL in the NVP group (P>0.05). By binary logistic regression, treatment group was not associated with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL (P>0.05). No patient in the EFV group and eight (7.2%) patients in the NVP group discontinued ART because of adverse reactions (P=0.084). For HIV-TB co-infected patients who receive rifampicin, efficacy of 600 mg EFV-based and 400 mg NVP-based ART may be similar, although adverse events tend to be higher in NVP-based ART. Standard-dose efavirenz vs. standard-dose nevirapine in antiretroviral regimens among HIV-1 and tuberculosis co-infected patients who received rifampicin. Manosuthi W, Mankatitham W, Lueangniyomkul A, et al. HIV Med, 2008, 9:294-299.Sixteen South African patients receiving ART including standard doses of nevirapine were admitted twice for intensive pharmacokinetic sampling: during and after rifampicin-based antitubercular therapy. Geometric mean ratios for nevirapine pharmacokinetic parameters during versus after antitubercular therapy were 0.61 [90% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.79] for Cmax, 0.64 (90% CI 0.52-0.80) for AUC and 0.68 (90% CI 0.53-0.86) for Cmin. Nevirapine Cmin was subtherapeutic (<3 mg/L) in six patients during antitubercular therapy (one of whom developed virological failure) and in none afterwards. There was no correlation between rifampicin concentrations and the degree of nevirapine induction assessed by the proportional change in nevirapine concentrations between the two admissions. The ratio of nevirapine AUC to the AUC of its 12-hydroxy metabolite was significantly lower in the presence of antitubercular therapy, consistent with induced metabolism. Nevirapine concentrations were significantly decreased by concomitant rifampicin-based antitubercular therapy and a high proportion of patients had subtherapeutic plasma concentrations. Effect of rifampicin-based antitubercular therapy on nevirapine plasma concentrations in South African adults with HIV-associated tuberculosis. Cohen K, van Cutsem G, Boulle A, et al. J Antimicrob Chemother, 2008, 61, 389-393.27 HIV-infected adult Malawians after starting Triomune (stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine) in the second week of tuberculosis treatment were studied. At baseline, 88% had CD4+ T-cell counts <100 cells/ml, all were anaemic and 78% were malnourished. Five patients (19%) died, two withdrew consent and one stopped all drugs due to hepatitis. At 6 months, all but one of the 19 remaining patients had good virological results (16 patients: <400 copies/ml, two patients: <1000 copies/ml) and the median CD4+ T cell increase was 170 cells/ml. Adverse events were numerous, particularly in the first 2 months. Suspected IRD episodes could be managed without treatment interruptions. During the lead-in phase, 59% of nevirapine plasma levels were sub-therapeutic despite good adherence, compared with only 14% during weeks 4 and 8. It is feasible to start Triomune early during TB treatment with good treatment outcome. The nevirapine lead-in phase should be avoided when rifampicin-based tuberculosis treatment is started >1 week beforehand. Nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy started early in the course of tuberculosis treatment in adult Malawians. Van Oosterhout JJ, Kumwenda JJ, Beadsworth M, et al. Antivir Ther, 2007, 12:515-521.Seventy patients with HIV and tuberculosis coinfection who initiated nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy and had trough nevirapine levels determined while receiving rifampicin were enrolled. After discontinuation of rifampicin therapy, mean nevirapine levels (+/- standard deviation) increased from 5.4+/-3.5 mg/L to 6.4+/-3.4 mg/L (P=0.047), but no nevirapine-related adverse events occurred. There was no statistically significant difference in 60-week antiviral efficacy between these patients and patients receiving nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy alone (P>0.05). Nevirapine levels after discontinuation of rifampicin therapy and 60-week efficacy of nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis. Manosuthi W, Ruxrungtham K, Likanonsakul S, et al. Clin Infect Dis, 2007, 44:141-144.The pharmacokinetic of nevirapine were determined 30 HIV-infected Thai subjects with active TB and on rifampicin randomized to receive nevirapine 400 mg (arm 1) or nevirapine 600 mg (arm 2). A nevirapine lead in was performed in both arms of 200 and 400 mg/day. Suboptimal nevirapine concentrations (<3.1 mg/L) were found in 77% of patients in the 400 mg arm at week 2 (after lead in period) compared to 13% of patients in the 600 mg arm. However the higher dose was associated with a high rate of hypersensitivity (4 patients). There was no difference in the 12 week efficacy data between the 2 arms (<50 copies; 53% vs 43% in arms 1 and 2 respectively). The authors concluded that nevirapine 400 mg/day may be sufficient in Asian (low body weight) patients receiving rifampicin but the 200 mg lead in should be avoided. Pharmacokinetic and 12 weeks efficacy of nevirapine: 400 mg versus 600 mg per day in HIV infected patients with active tuberculosis receiving rifampicin: a multicenter study. Avihingsanon A, et al. 14th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Los Angeles, February 2007, abstract 576.Seventy human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients receiving rifampicin and 70 HIV-infected patients not receiving rifampicin were enrolled to receive 400 mg of nevirapine-based highly active antiretroviral therapy per day. Mean plasma nevirapine levels at 8 and 12 weeks were lower in patients receiving rifampicin (P=0.048). However, virological and immunological outcomes at 24 weeks were not different between the 2 groups (P>0.05). Plasma nevirapine levels and 24-week efficacy in HIV-infected patients receiving nevirapine-based highly active antiretroviral therapy with or without rifampicin. Manosuthi W, Sungkanuparth S, Thakkinstian A, et al. Clin Infect Dis, 2006, 43: 253-255.Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and rifampicin (450 mg once daily if less than 60 kg; 600 mg once daily if >60 kg) was studied in 13 HIV+ subjects. Rifampicin caused significant reductions in nevirapine Cmax (42%), Cmin (53%) and AUC (46%) with 8/13 subjects having subtherapeutic concentrations (Cmin <3 µg/ml). Nevirapine dose was increased to 300 mg twice daily in 7/8 subjects and resulted in Cmin within the target range (3-12 µg/ml). Further studies to evaluate the long-term safety of the higher nevirapine dose are required. Increasing nevirapine dose can overcome reduced bioavailability due to rifampicin coadministration. Ramachandran G, Hemanthkumar AK, Rajasekaran S, et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2006, 42(1): 36-41.A pilot study to measure plasma concentrations of nevirapine was conducted in 27 HIV+ Malawian subjects who commenced Triomune (generic fixed-dose nevirapine, zidovudine and lamivudine) whilst receiving rifampicin based TB therapy. Despite good adherence, subtherapeutic nevirapine levels (<3000 ng/ml) were found in 37% of the 94 samples and in 78% of the patients on at least one occasion. However, 83% of the low levels occurred during the first two weeks of Triomune therapy when the standard nevirapine dose escalation schedule was used (i.e. 200 mg once daily for two weeks, then 200 mg twice daily).Sub-therapeutic nevirapine levels during combined Triomune® (stavudine + lamivudine + nevirapine) and tuberculosis treatment in Malawian adults. van Oosterhout JJG et al. 16th International AIDS Conference, Toronto, August 2006, abstract TUPE0091.NVP pharmacokinetic profiles were determined in 12 HIV- subjects receiving single doses of nevirapine (200 mg) alone and after 7 days of rifampicin (standard weight-related dose). Coadministration resulted in decreases in nevirapine AUC (79%), Cmax (20%) and Cmin (60%). The pharmacokinetics of single-dose nevirapine among healthy Indian volunteers was similar to that reported from other racial populations. Rifampicin induction significantly alters the pharmacokinetic profile of nevirapine in this population, and concurrent use should not be recommended. Effect of rifampin hepatic induction on nevirapine levels in Indian volunteers. Pujari et al. 13th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Denver, February, 2006, abstract 574.The effect of rifampicin on NVP pharmacokinetics was investigated in Thai patients receiving a generic fixed dose combination of stavudine/lamivudine/NVP alone (n=74) and in combination with rifampicin (n=70). There were no differences between the groups for age, gender, weight, height or BMI. Median (range) NVP trough concentrations when given alone were 8170 ng/ml (1550-13580; n=45) compared to 4430 ng/ml (650-13760; n=49) when given with rifampicin. Concentrations were below target (3100 ng/ml) in two patients receiving NVP alone, and in 7 patients receiving NVP with rifampicin. Multivariate analysis showed use of rifampicin and time of drug intake to be significantly associated with NVP concentrations. Nevirapine plasma concentrations in the presence of rifampicin (HIV-NAT 025). Autar, R et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 21.Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and rifampicin was investigated in a cross sectional study in 13 Thai patients. The mean nevirapine plasma concentration was 12690 ng/ml and 12/13 patients had concentrations that exceeded the lower clinical limit (3000 ng/ml). What is the clinical relevance of the drug interaction between nevirapine and rifampicin? Autar R, Mahanontharit A, Anekthananon T, et al., 11th International AIDS Conference, Bangkok, July 2004, abstract B11784.Coadministration of nevirapine and rifampicin was studied in 10 HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis. In the presence of rifampicin, nevirapine AUC was reduced by 31%, Cmax by 36% and Cmin by 21%. Exposure to rifampicin was not significantly different in the presence of nevirapine. Given that the lowest trough nevirapine concentration was 40x the protein binding adjusted median infective dose (IC50) of wild type HIV, the authors suggest that there is no need to increase nevirapine dosage when it is given with rifampicin.Pharmacokinetic interaction between nevirapine and rifampicin in HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis. Ribera E, Pou L, Lopez RM, et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2001, 28:450-453.Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) with rifampicin (600 mg once daily) to 22 HIV+ individuals resulted in no significant change in rifampicin AUC or Cmax compared to baseline levels. Average nevirapine concentration was reduced by 58% and Cmin was reduced by 68% compared to historical controls. There are insufficient data to assess whether dose adjustments are necessary. Consideration should be given to increasing the nevirapine dose by 50% (to 300 mg twice daily) if given concurrently with rifampicin. However, there are no safety data available for the combination at this dose of nevirapine and it should only be used if clearly indicated and with careful monitoring.
