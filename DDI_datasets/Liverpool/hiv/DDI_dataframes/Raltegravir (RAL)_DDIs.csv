Reynolds H, Lewis J, Egan D, et al. CROI 2018, Boston, March 2018, abstract 470.The effect of calcium carbonate and magnesium/aluminium hydroxide antacids on the pharmacokinetics of a 1200 mg dose of raltegravir was assessed in 20 HIV-infected patients. Drug administration was as follows: 1200 mg of raltegravir alone (period 1), calcium carbonate antacid as Tums® Ultra Strength (US) 1000 and 1200 mg raltegravir given concomitantly (period 2), magnesium/aluminium hydroxide antacid as 20 ml Maalox® Maximum Strength substitute MS given 12 h after administration of 1200 mg raltegravir (period 3), and calcium carbonate antacid as TUMS® US 1000 given 12 h after administration of 1200 mg raltegravir (period 4). Metal-cation antacids variably affected the pharmacokinetics of 1200 mg once daily raltegravir. When calcium carbonate antacid was given with 1200 mg raltegravir concomitantly, the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and its associated 90% confidence interval (90% CI) for AUC0-24 , Cmax and C24 h were 0.28 (0.24, 0.32), 0.26 (0.21, 0.32) and 0.52 (0.45, 0.61), respectively. When calcium carbonate antacid and magnesium/aluminium hydroxide were given 12 h after raltegravir 1200 mg once daily dosing, the GMR (90% CI) values for AUC0-24 and Cmax were 0.90 (0.80, 1.03), 0.98 (0.81, 1.17), and 0.86 (0.73, 1.03), 0.86 (0.65, 1.15), respectively. However, significant reduction in the trough concentrations of raltegravir was observed: C24 h 0.43 (0.36, 0.51) in the presence of calcium carbonate antacids and 0.42 (0.34, 0.52) in presence of magnesium/aluminium hydroxide, respectively. Overall, the use of metal-cation antacids with 1200 mg once daily raltegravir is not recommended.Effect of metal-cation antacids on the pharmacokinetics of 1200 mg raltegravir. Krishna R, et al. J Pharm Pharmacol, 2016, 68 (11): 1359-65.The pharmacokinetics of single-dose raltegravir (400 mg) were studied in healthy volunteers with and without an antacid (Maalox Plus containing both magnesium and aluminium hydroxide).  Although raltegravir AUC and Cmax were unchanged with simultaneous antacid administration, the time to peak occurred 2 hours sooner and there was a 67% reduction in C12h. The authors speculate that antacid may have two effects on raltegravir pharmacokinetics.  First to cause a faster and more uniform dissolution (earlier Tmax and less variability) and secondly binding of raltegravir to the antacid which offsets the potential for an increase in extend of absorption.  However, it is not known if the reduction in raltegravir C12h would compromise the efficiency of the drug.Effect of antacids on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in human immunodeficiency virus-seronegative volunteers. Kiser J, Bumpass JB, Meditz AL, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2010, 54(12): 4999-5003.The effects of pH, metal salts, and omeprazole on the cellular permeativity of raltegravir were determined using Caco-2 monolayers. Cellular accumulation studies were used to determine the effect of interplay between pH and ABCB1 transport on raltegravir accumulation. Raltegravir cellular permeativity was heavily influenced by changes in extracellular pH, where apical-to-basolateral permeativity was reduced 9-fold (P < 0.05) when apical pH was increased from 5 to 8.5. Raltegravir cellular permeativity was also reduced in the presence of magnesium and calcium. Omeprazole did not alter raltegravir cellular permeativity. Gastrointestinal pH and polyvalent metals can potentially alter the pharmacokinetic properties of raltegravir, and these data provide an explanation for the variability in raltegravir exposure in patients. The evaluation of how divalent-metal-containing products, such as multivitamins, that do not affect gastric pH alter raltegravir pharmacokinetics in patients is now justified.Moss DM, Siccardi M, Murphy M et al.

Raltegravir AUC, Cmax and C24 increased 27%, 16% and 26%, respectively. The authors hypothesise UGT1A1 inhibition by atazanavir as the mechanism of increased raltegravir exposure. This hypothesis is supported by the observation of elevated bilirubin levels (a UGT1A1 substrate) during atazanavir administration. Atazanavir PK were not studied as raltegravir does not inhibit or induce enzymes involved in atazanavir dispersal.Atazanavir increases the plasma concentrations of 1200 mg raltegravir dose. Krishna R, East L, Larson P et al. 2016, Biopharm Drug Dispos, 37(9): 533-541.The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir and raltegravir were investigated in 19 HIV- subjects receiving twice-daily unboosted atazanavir (300 mg twice daily) and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily). Coadministration decreased atazanavir AUC (17%), Cmax (11%) and Cmin (29%). Atazanavir Cmin was 817 ng/ml (GM, range 250-1550 ng/ml) which is well the above the 10-fold protein binding adjusted EC90 for atazanavir against wild-type HIV, and was moderately lower than historical values obtained with atazanavir/ritonavir. When given with atazanavir, the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of raltegravir increased by 54%, 39% and 48%, respectively.

Coadministration of raltegravir (100 mg single dose) with atazanavir (400 mg once daily for 7 days) increased raltegravir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 72%, 53% and 95%, respectively. When the recommended dose of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) was given with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily), raltegravir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 41%, 24% and 77%, respectively. The authors conclude that the increase in plasma concentrations of raltegravir is not clinically important and does not require dosage adjustment. Atazanavir modestly increases plasma levels of raltegravir in healthy subjects. Iwamoto M, Wenning LA, Mistry GC, et al.

High inter-individual variability was observed along with significant intra-individual diurnal variation when given twice daily. Despite a significant reduction in raltegravir-glucuronide concentrations, atazanavir did not significantly increase raltegravir concentrations. When given twice daily, geometric mean raltegravir trough concentration, Cmax and AUC were 40 ng/ml, 1016 ng/ml and 3934 ng/ml.h), respectively. When given once daily with atazanavir, raltegravir trough concentration, Cmax and AUC were 1402 ng/ml (37% increase), 13 ng/ml (67% decrease) and 5541 ng/ml.h, respectively.

Administration of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily should be separated by at least 4 hours. Importantly, drug-drug interaction studies with antacids containing divalent cations have shown a more pronounced reduction in raltegravir Cmin when raltegravir was administered once daily compared to a twice daily regimen.

Raltegravir does not inhibit or induce UGT1A1.,"In vitro studies show that at supra-physiological concentrations, cannabidiol (CBD) is an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. Observed plasma concentrations of CBD with doses used in clinical use are a couple of orders of magnitude smaller than those required for inhibition of P-gp and BCRP. Thus, substrates of these transporters are unlikely to be victims of a drug interaction with CBD.

Anderson MS, Sekar V, Tomaka F, et al. 48th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Washington, October 2008, abstract A-962.Darunavir trough concentrations were determined in 117 samples from 55 HIV+ patients receiving darunavir containing regimens with either a NRTI or raltegravir. Mean (± sd) darunavir concentrations were higher in the NRTI subjects than in the raltegravir subjects (4.20 ± 2.35 vs 2.63 ± 84 mg/L). However, the proportion of subjects with undetectable viral loads (<50 copies/ml) was higher in the raltegravir group than in the NRTI group.

The first case had raltegravir trough concentrations of 189 and 313 ng/ml on two occasions whilst on darunavir/ritonavir, enfuvirtide and raltegravir. After switching enfuvirtide for etravirine, raltegravir trough concentrations decreased to 10 ng/ml and then to 5 ng/ml one month later. The second case started a combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine, etravirine and raltegravir. Tenofovir trough concentrations were in the expected range, but raltegravir trough concentrations were considered low (30 ng/ml). Increasing raltegravir from 800 mg/day to 1200 mg/day resulted in an increase in trough concentration (67 ng/ml). The third case had low raltegravir trough concentrations on two occasions (12 and 9 ng/ml) whilst receiving darunavir/ritonavir, etravirine and raltegravir. The final case switched to tenofovir, etravirine and raltegravir. Etravirine trough concentrations were within the normal range, but raltegravir trough concentrations were low (29 ng/ml).

Taburet AM, Sauvageon H, Grinsztejn B, et al. Clin Infect Dis, 2015, 61:1328-1335.Over a period of 38 days, healthy subjects received 5 days of standard-dose raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) followed by 28 days of standard-dose raltegravir plus rifampicin three times a week followed by 5 days of high-dose (800 mg twice daily) raltegravir plus rifampicin three times a week. Sixteen subjects (12 females) completed the study. Raltegravir trough plasma concentration (C12) was significantly lower in the presence of rifampicin when dosed at 400 mg twice daily (40%), which was not observed with 800 mg twice daily dosing. Raltegravir Cmax and AUC were both significantly higher in the presence of rifampicin when dosed at 800 mg twice daily (76% and 84%, respectively), but this dose was well tolerated. This study suggests that rifampicin induction of raltegravir is comparable between daily and intermittent rifampicin. In the absence of definitive clinical efficacy data to suggest otherwise, doses of 800 mg of raltegravir twice daily with rifampicin thrice weekly are well tolerated and yield higher AUCs and comparable C12 when compared with raltegravir alone. Effect of intermittent rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics and safety of raltegravir. Reynolds HE, Chrdle A, Egan D, et al. J Antimicrob Chemother, 2015, 70:550-554.In a multicentre, randomised trial at eight sites in Brazil and France, 155 antiretroviral-naive adult patients with HIV-1 and tuberculosis (aged ≥18 years with a plasma HIV RNA concentration of >1000 copies per mL) were randomised to receive raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir 800 mg twice daily, or efavirenz 600 mg once daily plus tenofovir and lamivudine. Patients began study treatment after the start of tuberculosis treatment. 153 (51 in each group) received at least one dose of the study drug and were included in the primary analysis. 133 patients (87%) completed follow-up at week 48. At week 24, virological suppression was achieved in 39 patients (76%, 95% CI 65-88) in the raltegravir 400 mg group, 40 patients (78%, 67-90) in the raltegravir 800 mg group, and 32 patients (63%, 49-76) in the efavirenz group. The adverse-event profile was much the same across the three groups. Three (6%) patients allocated to efavirenz and three (6%) patients allocated to raltegravir 800 mg twice daily discontinued the study drugs due to adverse events. Seven patients died during the study (one in the raltegravir 400 mg group, four in the raltegravir 800 mg group, and two in the efavirenz group): none of the deaths was deemed related to study treatment. Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily might be an alternative to efavirenz for the treatment of patients co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis. Raltegravir for the treatment of patients co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis (ANRS 12 180 Reflate TB): a multicenter, phase 2, non-comparative, open-label, randomized trial. Grinsztejn B, de Castro N, Arnold V, et al. Lancet Infect Dis, 2014, 14:459-467.Two studies were conducted to examine the effect of rifampicin administration on raltegravir pharmacokinetics. Study 1 examined rifampicin (600 mg once daily) on the PK of single dose raltegravir (400 mg); study 2 examined rifampicin (600 mg once daily) on the PK of raltegravir (800 mg twice daily) compared to raltegravir alone (400 mg twice daily). The results demonstrated a substantial effect of rifampicin. In study 1 raltegravir exposure decreased by 61% (C12h), 40% (AUC) and 38% (Cmax). In study 2, raltegravir trough concentrations decreased by 53%, but AUC and Cmax increased by 27% and 62%. Doubling the dose of raltegravir to 800 mg when given with rifampicin compensated for the effect on AUC but not on C12h. On the basis of these data, the recommendation is that if coadministration is unavoidable, a doubling of the raltegravir dose should be considered. Effect of rifampin, a potent inducer of drug metabolising enzymes, on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Wenning LA, Hanley WD, Brainard DM, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2009, 53(7): 2852-2856.It was investigated whether increasing raltegravir to 800 mg twice daily when given with rifampicin (600 mg once daily) could overcome the inducing effect of rifampicin. When compared to raltegravir alone (400 mg twice daily), coadministration of the higher dose with rifampicin decreased raltegravir trough concentrations by 53%, but increased AUC and Cmax by 27% and 62%, respectively. Therefore, doubling the dose of raltegravir does not overcome the effect of rifampicin on raltegravir trough concentrations. Doubling the dose of raltegravir does not increase trough levels in the presence of rifampin. Brainaird DM, Petry A, Hanley WD, et al. 48th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Washington, October 2008, abstract A-964.The effect of rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 14 days) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of raltegravir (400 mg) was studied in 10 HIV- subjects.

Monitor response to antiviral therapy. A recent study suggests a low risk of a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction with low-hyperforin formulations (<1 mg/day) of St John’s Wort (hyperforin is the constituent responsible for induction of CYPs and P-gp).","In drug interaction studies, efavirenz did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily; therefore, other less potent inducers (e.g., St. John's wort) may be used with the recommended dose of raltegravir.Isentress 600 mg Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, May 2019.In a phase I, open-label, non-randomized, single-sequence study, a low-hyperforin St John’s wort extract was investigated using a drug cocktail in 20 healthy volunteers. No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and P-glycoprotein, with AUC and Cmax of the probe drugs showing 90% confidence intervals well within the predefined bioequivalence range of 80-125% (GMR, drugs taken together with extract vs. probe drug alone). These data suggest that low hyperforin preparations of St John’s wort have a lower risk of drug-drug interactions than high hyperforin St. John’s wort preparations.No clinically relevant interactions of St. John's Wort extract Ze 117 low in hyperforin with cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein.

714,Raltegravir (RAL),Valproate,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Valproate is mainly glucuronidated by UGTs 1A6, 1A9 and 2B7 and metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Valproate has no inducing effects on metabolism. Valproate has been shown to significantly reduce total dolutegravir concentrations due to protein binding displacement. However, this interaction is not clinically relevant since the concentrations of free dolutegravir (pharmacologically active) are not decreased. Valproate is unlikely to cause a clinically significant interaction with raltegravir as supported by data issued from a TDM registry showing no effect of valproate on raltegravir levels.","A previously observed drug-drug interaction between valproate and was hypothesized to occur either due to protein binding displacement or due to chelation with magnesium contained in the excipients of slow release valproate formulations. This study was conducted to assess whether valproate reduces other antiretroviral drugs, notably integrase inhibitors. A total of 134 patients receiving valproate together with antiretroviral drugs were identified from a TDM registry. With the exception of dolutegravir (n=29), no significant decrease in emtricitabine (n=45), tenofovir-DF (n=35), lamivudine (n=16), abacavir (n=10), etravirine (n=10), rilpivirine (n=7), nevirapine (n=3), (efavirenz (n=2), maraviroc (n=17), atazanavir (n=24), darunavir (n=13), lopinavir (n=4) or raltegravir (n=27) were observed. Further investigation showed no significant differences in raltegravir concentrations at 2-4 h post dose (349 vs 746 ng/ml) or 10-14 h post dose (384 vs 216 ng/ml) for subjects receiving raltegravir and valproate when compared to 1092 patients on raltegravir without valproate. The results of this study suggest that the observed decrease in dolutegravir exposure is unlikely to be due to chelation with divalent cations.Valproic acid co-administration is not associated with lower non-dolutegravir antiretrovirals’ exposure. Calcagno A,Cusato J, Ferrara M, et al. 20th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV, Hepatitis, and Other Antiviral Drugs, May 2019, abstract 43.Concentrations of total and free dolutegravir were determined to elucidate the mechanism of the previously observed drug-drug interaction between valproate and dolutegravir. The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) were assessed in 3 HIV infected individuals in presence and absence of valproate (Depakine enteric; 30 mg/kg, divided in two daily oral doses administered during 14 days). Samples for total and free dolutegravir Ctrough plasma concentration were taken on day 0 (prior to coadministration of valproate) and on day 1, 7, 14 (all with valproate), and finally on day 42 (without valproate). Subjects in study arms on dolutegravir without valproate served as controls. Total dolutegravir trough levels (mean ± SD) prior and after valproate 2.1 ± 1.4 mg/L on day 0 and 1.6 ± 0.67 mg/L on day 42. Of interest, coadministration of valproate decreased sharply total dolutegravir Ctrough on days 1, 7, and 14: 0.89 ± 0.57, 0.40 ± 0.30 and 0.28 ± 0.21 mg/L, respectively. Conversely, the free fraction of dolutegravir increased from 0.29-0.30% without valproate administration to 0.54-0.7% during valproate coadministration. Importantly, all free dolutegravir concentrations were above the proposed in vitro EC90 value of unbound dolutegravir (0.9 µg/L). This study demonstrates that the reported decreased in total dolutegravir concentrations with concomitant use of valproate is due to protein displacement. Since the free fraction (pharmacologically active) of dolutegravir is not reduced, this drug-drug interaction is unlikely to be of clinical relevance.The valproic acid - dolutegravir drug-drug interaction is based on displacement of protein binding and unlikely to be clinically relevant.

May 2019, abstract 44.A retrospective analysis of dolutegravir trough concentrations in 363 samples (from 149 patients) showed lower trough concentrations in 11 samples from 7 patients on valproic acid (0.068 µg/ml vs 0.557 µg/ml). Detailed pharmacokinetic sampling was performed in two hospitalized patients requiring valproic acid while on dolutegravir-based regimens. When compared to a mean reference AUC value of 75.1 μg·h/mL for dolutegravir twice daily, dolutegravir AUC in the first patient was 82% lower with IV valproic acid and 87-91% lower with oral valproic acid.

For drug interaction reasons, the patient was switched from a PI-based regimen to raltegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine and calcium carbonate (1 g-vitamin D3 400 IU 3 times/day) was added for prevention of osteoporosis. After 10 months of an undetectable viral load and clinical evidence of a high level of adherence on this regimen, the patient developed detectable HIV-1 RNA levels with documented resistance to raltegravir His antiretroviral therapy was changed back to a protease inhibitor-based regimen, and his HIV-1 RNA level rapidly resuppressed. Therapeutic drug monitoring at the time of virologic failure showed lower than expected raltegravir concentrations at 5 hour post dose, but tenofovir and emtricitabine concentrations were within the expected range.
