1,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Acamprosate,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Acamprosate is eliminated unchanged in the urine both via glomerular filtration and active secretion (renal transporter unknown, possibly OATs or OCTs). A clinically significant interaction with bictegravir is unlikely. Tenofovir alafenamide is unlikely to compete with acamprosate for renal transporters as tenofovir alafenamide results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. However, acamprosate and emtricitabine may compete for tubular secretion, which could lead to increased concentrations of either drug. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown. ",(See Summary)

4,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Acetazolamide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Acetazolamide is predominantly excreted unchanged via active renal tubular secretion. In vitro studies have shown acetazolamide may competitively inhibit renal transporters OAT1, OAT3 and OAT4. Inhibition of these renal transporters is unlikely to lead to significant increase in tenofovir as tenofovir alafenamide results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. Emtricitabine and bictegravir do not interact with acetazolamide elimination pathway.",(See Summary)
5,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Aciclovir (Acyclovir),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aciclovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1. Bictegravir does not interfere with aciclovir elimination. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are unlikely to compete with aciclovir for renal transporters as emtricitabine is eliminated by different renal transporters and tenofovir alafenamide results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. ,"Because FTC and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Biktarvy with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of FTC, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include acyclovir.Biktarvy US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, August 2019."
6,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Acitretin,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but, based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as acitretin undergoes isomerisation and glucuronidation.

10,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Adrenaline (Epinephrine),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated, mostly in the liver by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). ",(See Summary)
11,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),African Potato,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. African potato was shown to inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp in vitro and to activate PXR suggesting that inhibition may occur initially followed by induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp when used for extended periods. Bictegravir exposure could potentially be decreased as it partly metabolized by CYP3A4. Tenofovir alafenamide (the prodrug of tenofovir) is a substrate of P-gp and its absorption may be decreased due to induction of intestinal P-gp by African potato. No effect on emtricitabine is expected.,(See Summary)
12,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Agomelatine,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

14,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Albuvirtide,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Biktarvy (bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide) is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV 1 infection and should not be administered with other antiretroviral products. However, in specific clinical situations where an intensification of HIV treatment is needed, coadministration with albuvirtide would be possible from a pharmacokinetic standpoint. Bictegravir is metabolized by CYP3A and UGT1A1; tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine are eliminated renally. In vitro human microsomal studies and limited in vivo drug-drug interaction data indicate that albuvirtide has no inhibiting or inducing properties on P450 enzymes. Albuvirtide is a peptide which is eliminated by catabolism to its constituent amino acids. No interaction is expected with bictegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide.","Biktarvy should not be co-administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products.Biktarvy Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, June 2019.As Biktarvy is a complete regimen, coadministration with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is not recommended.Biktarvy Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, August 2019."
15,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Alcohol,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolic profiles of both drugs there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. Alcohol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. The chronic use of alcohol may induce CYP2E1 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4, however, no clinically relevant effect is expected on bictegravir exposure. Significant interactions are not expected with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide.",(See Summary)
16,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Alcuronium,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Alcuronium is predominantly eliminated unchanged via the kidneys. As there are no available data determining whether excretion is via active tubular secretion or glomerular filtration, there is some potential for exposure of alcuronium to be increased since bictegravir inhibits the renal transporters OCT2 and MATE1. Caution is advised as alcuronium has a narrow therapeutic index. In addition, competition with emtricitabine for active renal transport mechanisms cannot be excluded, which may lead to increased levels of either drug. This mechanism of interaction is unlikely to be relevant for tenofovir alafenamide as this prodrug results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. ",(See Summary)
17,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Alendronic Acid,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. If taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product. ",(See Summary)
18,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Alfentanil,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

20,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Aliskiren,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aliskiren is minimally metabolized and is mainly excreted unchanged in faeces. P-glycoprotein is a major determinant of aliskiren bioavailability. Significant interactions are not expected with bictegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide. ",(See Summary)
21,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Allopurinol,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as allopurinol is converted to oxipurinol by xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase.

23,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Aloe vera,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Bictegravir is metabolized equally by CYP3A4 and UGT1A1. Aloe vera is only a weak inhibitor of CYPs in vitro and therefore is unlikely to cause clinically significant interactions. It does not inhibit P-gp and there is no evidence to suggest it impacts UGTs. No interaction with emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide is expected.",(See Summary)
24,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Alosetron,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely.

26,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Amantadine,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Amantadine is mainly eliminated in the kidney by glomerular filtration and active secretion via OCT2. Bictegravir is unlikely to cause a clinically significant interaction via inhibition of OCT2. Emtricitabine and tenofovir derived from tenofovir alafenamide are unlikely to interfere with amantadine renal elimination as they are eliminated by different renal transporters. ,(See Summary)
27,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Ambrisentan,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Ambrisentan is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A9, UGT2B7, UGT1A3 and is metabolized to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Ambrisentan is also a substrate of P-gp and OATP1B1.

28,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Amikacin,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Amikacin is eliminated by glomerular filtration therefore no interaction is expected with bictegravir or emtricitabine. Coadministration with nephrotoxic agents is unlikely to be of concern for tenofovir alafenamide which results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. ,"Because FTC and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Biktarvy with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of FTC, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions.

29,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Amiloride,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Amiloride is eliminated unchanged by the kidney. In vitro data indicate that amiloride is a substrate of OCT2. Bictegravir inhibits OCT2 to some extent but is unlikely to cause a clinically relevant drug interaction with amiloride. Furthermore, emtricitabine and tenofovir derived from tenofovir alafenamide are unlikely to compete for renal elimination as they are eliminated by other renal transporters",(See Summary)
30,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Aminophylline,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aminophylline is a complex of theophylline and ethylenediamine and is given for its theophylline activity. Theophylline is mainly metabolized by CYP1A2. Bictegravir does not inhibit or induce P450 enzymes; emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide do not interact with aminophylline’s metabolic pathway.,(See Summary)
31,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Amiodarone,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Amiodarone is metabolized by CYPs 3A4 and 2C8, but bictegravir does not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes. Amiodarone is a P-gp inhibitor and coadministration is expected to increase bictegravir concentrations but to a modest extent. Coadministration of bictegravir with darunavir/cobicistat (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) increased bictegravir exposure by 74%. This increase is unlikely to be clinically significant; available dose exposure data, as well as data from phase 2 and phase 3 studies (48 weeks treatment), have shown a good safety profile with up to a 2.4 fold increase in bictegravir AUC. However, tenofovir alafenamide (the prodrug of tenofovir) is a substrate of P-gp and inhibitors of P-gp such as amiodarone are expected to increase the absorption of tenofovir alafenamide and thereby increase the systemic concentration. The recommended dose of 10 mg tenofovir alafenamide with P-gp inhibitors is not possible with Biktarvy which is only available as a fixed dose combination containing 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide but it should be noted that tenofovir alafenamide has been associated with a large clinical safety profile. ","The antiviral activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of short-term monotherapy with bictegravir was evaluated in a phase 1b, randomized, double-blinded, adaptive, sequential cohort, placebo-controlled study.

584,Bictegravir/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF),Quinidine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Quinidine is metabolized by CYP3A4 but bictegravir does not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes. Quinidine is a P-gp inhibitor and coadministration is expected to increase bictegravir concentrations, but to a modest extent. Coadministration of bictegravir with darunavir/cobicistat (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) increased bictegravir exposure by 74%. This increase is unlikely to be clinically significant; available dose exposure data, as well as data from phase 2 and phase 3 studies (48 weeks treatment), have shown a good safety profile with up to a 2.4 fold increase in bictegravir AUC. However, tenofovir alafenamide (the prodrug of tenofovir) is a substrate of P-gp and inhibitors of P-gp such as quinidine are expected to increase the absorption of tenofovir alafenamide and thereby increase the systemic concentration. The recommended dose of 10 mg tenofovir alafenamide with P-gp inhibitors is not possible with Biktarvy which is only available as a fixed dose combination containing 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide but it should be noted that tenofovir alafenamide has been associated with a large clinical safety profile. ","The antiviral activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of short-term monotherapy with bictegravir was evaluated in a phase 1b, randomized, double-blinded, adaptive, sequential cohort, placebo-controlled study.

Coadministration of rifampin (600 mg once daily) and bictegravir (75 mg single dose) decreased bictegravir Cmax and AUC by 28% and 75%. Biktarvy Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, August 2019.The effect of rifampicin (600 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of bictegravir when administered twice daily (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir 50/200/25 mg, twice daily postprandial, for 28 days) was investigated in two cohorts of HIV-negative subjects (n=26 per cohort). Cohort 1 received bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alone while cohort 2 received the same plus rifampicin. Coadministration reduced bictegravir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough by approximately 61%, 47% and 80%, respectively. The authors note that although bictegravir Ctrough decreased by ~80%, trough concentrations in all subjects were above the protein adjusted EC95 of 162 ng/ml. They conclude that administering bictegravir twice daily with rifampicin did not mitigate the enzyme inducing effect of rifampicin sufficiently to replicate the Ctrough concentrations seen in phase three bictegravir clinical trials.Custodio JM, West SK, Collins S, et al.

Valproate is mainly glucuronidated by UGTs 1A6, 1A9 and 2B7 and metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Valproate has no inducing effects on metabolism. Valproate has been shown to significantly reduce total dolutegravir concentrations due to protein binding displacement. However, this interaction is not clinically relevant since the concentrations of free dolutegravir (pharmacologically active) are not decreased. Similarly, valproate is unlikely to cause a clinically significant interaction with bictegravir. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide do not interact with these metabolic pathways.","Concentrations of total and free dolutegravir were determined to elucidate the mechanism of the previously observed drug-drug interaction between valproate and dolutegravir. The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) were assessed in 3 HIV infected individuals in presence and absence of valproate (Depakine enteric; 30 mg/kg, divided in two daily oral doses administered during 14 days). Samples for total and free dolutegravir Ctrough plasma concentration were taken on day 0 (prior to coadministration of valproate) and on day 1, 7, 14 (all with valproate), and finally on day 42 (without valproate). Subjects in study arms on dolutegravir without valproate served as controls. Total dolutegravir trough levels (mean ± SD) prior and after valproate 2.1 ± 1.4 mg/L on day 0 and 1.6 ± 0.67 mg/L on day 42.

Conversely, the free fraction of dolutegravir increased from 0.29-0.30% without valproate administration to 0.54-0.7% during valproate coadministration. Importantly, all free dolutegravir concentrations were above the proposed in vitro EC90 value of unbound dolutegravir (0.9 µg/L). This study demonstrates that the reported decreased in total dolutegravir concentrations with concomitant use of valproate is due to protein displacement. Since the free fraction (pharmacologically active) of dolutegravir is not reduced, this drug-drug interaction is unlikely to be of clinical relevance.The valproic acid - dolutegravir drug-drug interaction is based on displacement of protein binding and unlikely to be clinically relevant.

Bictegravir is metabolized equally by CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 and is a substrate of P-gp. Verapamil is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp and predicted to increase bictegravir concentrations but to a modest extent. Coadministration of bictegravir with darunavir/cobicistat (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) increased bictegravir exposure by 74%. This increase is unlikely to be clinically significant; available dose exposure data, as well as data from phase 2 and phase 3 studies (48 weeks treatment), have shown a good safety profile with up to a 2.4 fold increase in bictegravir AUC. However, tenofovir alafenamide (the prodrug of tenofovir) is a substrate of P-gp and inhibitors of P-gp such as verapamil are expected to increase the absorption of tenofovir alafenamide and thereby increase the systemic concentration. The recommended dose of 10 mg tenofovir alafenamide with P-gp inhibitors is not possible with Biktarvy which is only available as a fixed dose combination containing 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide but it should be noted that tenofovir alafenamide has been associated with a large clinical safety profile.","Bictegravir is both a P-gp and a BCRP substrate.
