50,Dolutegravir/Lamivudine (DTG/3TC),Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) [in multivitamins],Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Ascorbic acid is oxidised to dehydroascorbic acid where some is metabolised to oxalic acid and the inactive ascorbate-2-sulphate. Large doses of ascorbic acid may cause the urine to become acidic causing unexpected renal tubular reabsorption of acidic drugs, thus producing an exaggerated response. Conversely basic drugs may exhibit decreased reabsorption resulting in a decreased therapeutic effect. Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated unchanged via active renal tubular secretion, however unless treatment with ascorbic acid involves large doses of prolonged duration, significant interactions are not expected. A pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely with dolutegravir and vitamin C itself as dolutegravir does not interfere with this metabolic pathway.

364,Dolutegravir/Lamivudine (DTG/3TC),Isoniazid,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Isoniazid is acetylated in the liver to form acetylisoniazid which is then hydrolysed to isonicotinic acid and acetylhydrazine. Dolutegravir is unlikely to interfere with this metabolic pathway and no interaction is expected with lamivudine. However, a study of coadministration of dolutegravir and isoniazid with rifapentine was ended early due to intolerance. In healthy volunteers receiving weekly isoniazid and rifapentine, the addition of dolutegravir resulted in flu-like symptoms and LFT elevations in 2 out of 4 patients (with higher than expected isoniazid concentrations), leading to study termination. Limited pharmacokinetic data suggested lower dolutegravir exposure. Intolerance is likely to be related to rifapentine (+/- healthy volunteer status) rather than isoniazid, since in the INSPIRING study, the addition of dolutegravir to daily isoniazid and rifampicin was well tolerated in 69 HIV-TB coinfected adults at 24 week analysis.","An open-label, intrasubject drug interaction study in HIV-negative healthy volunteers comprised investigated the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir once daily alone and with once weekly isoniazid and rifapentine. Of 4 enrolled subjects (3 males, 1 female, age 22-46 years), 3 completed the study and 1 withdrew prior to the 3rd dose of isoniazid/rifapentine. The study was stopped prematurely due to the development of multiple AEs in 2 subjects. In both subjects, flu-like syndrome with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and fever (Grades 2 and 3) began ~8 hours after the last doses of dolutegravir, rifapentine, and isoniazid and lasted 24-48 hours. One subject required a 24-hour hospitalization for management of orthostatic hypotension (Grade 3). Transaminase elevations (Grades 2-4) occurred in both subjects. Exposure to rifapentine and its active metabolite were similar to reference PK data, but isoniazid exposure was 67-92% higher than expected in the 2 subjects who developed AEs. Limited pharmacokinetic data suggested isoniazid/rifapentine decreased dolutegravir AUC and Cmin by 46% and 74%. Given that flu-like syndrome was reported in <4% of subjects in studies of the efficacy of weekly isoniazid/rifapentine alone, these data suggest that co-administration of dolutegravir and weekly isoniazid/rifapentine should be avoided.Early termination of a PK study between dolutegravir and weekly isoniazid/rifapentine.

Dolutegravir trough concentrations were determined after at least 4 weeks of therapy and were 1123 ng/ml (820-1746 mg; median with range). Rifampicin did not significantly impact lamivudine and tenofovir plasma concentrations. After 48 weeks of therapy, two patients had plasma viral loads >50 copies/ml and were found to have dolutegravir trough concentrations below the target of 640 ng/ml, corresponding to an inhibitory quotient of 0.1 and 5.

No significant interaction is expected with lamivudine. However, coadministration may substantially decrease dolutegravir concentrations as rifapentine has a comparable inducing effect to rifampicin. Although no dosing recommendations are provided for rifapentine, the European and US labels for Dovato recommend that an additional dolutegravir 50 mg tablet, separated by 12 hours from Dovato, should be taken with rifampicin. Considering the limited experience when coadministering inducers with dual antiretroviral regimens, close monitoring of HIV infection is recommended.Â In healthy volunteers receiving weekly rifapentine and isoniazid, the addition of dolutegravir resulted in flu-like symptoms and LFT elevations in 2 out of 4 patients, leading to study termination. Intolerance was hypothesized be related to rifapentine (+/- healthy volunteer status) rather than isoniazid, since in the INSPIRING study the addition of dolutegravir to daily rifampicin and isoniazid was well tolerated in HIV-TB co-infected adults. Thus, the coadministration of dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) and rifapentine/isoniazid once weekly was evaluated again in HIV infected individuals and was well tolerated in persons living with HIV (no Grade >3 adverse effects). Dolutegravir Ctrough and AUC were reduced by ~50% and ~30% but median values at all time points were above 300 ng/ml. Virologic suppression was maintained throughout the TB treatment.Â Close monitoring of HIV infection is also recommended when using rifapentine once weekly with a daily dose of Dovato considering the limited experience when coadministering inducers with dual antiretroviral regimens.","Once weekly rifapentine/isoniazid doses (900/900 mg) for 3 months (3HP) coadministered with once daily dolutegravir has resulted in serious adverse events in a previous study conducted in healthy volunteers requiring the premature interruption of the study.

The geometric mean (GM) dolutegravir trough concentration pre-HP was 1003 Âµg/mL (5th-95th percentile: 500-2080), and during HP treatment 546 (134-1616) with all trough levels but one above dolutegravir IC90 of 64 Âµg/mL. Overall, HP coadministration decreased dolutegravir AUC by 29%, while clearance remained unchanged. HIV viral loads at baseline, pre-HP, after the third HP dose and post-3HP treatment remained < 40 copies/mL. No HP-related Grade >3 adverse effects were observed in the study participants.

Of 4 enrolled subjects (3 males, 1 female, age 22-46 years), 3 completed the study and 1 withdrew prior to the 3rd dose of isoniazid/rifapentine. The study was stopped prematurely due to the development of multiple AEs in 2 subjects. In both subjects, flu-like syndrome with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and fever (Grades 2 and 3) began ~8 hours after the last doses of dolutegravir, rifapentine, and isoniazid and lasted 24-48 hours. One subject required a 24-hour hospitalization for management of orthostatic hypotension (Grade 3). Transaminase elevations (Grades 2-4) occurred in both subjects. Exposure to rifapentine and its active metabolite were similar to reference PK data, but isoniazid exposure was 67-92% higher than expected in the 2 subjects who developed AEs. Limited pharmacokinetic data suggested isoniazid/rifapentine decreased dolutegravir AUC and Cmin by 46% and 74%.

However, this interaction is not clinically relevant since the concentrations of free dolutegravir (pharmacologically active) are not decreased. No interaction is expected with lamivudine.","Concentrations of total and free dolutegravir were determined to elucidate the mechanism of the previously observed drug-drug interaction between valproate and dolutegravir. The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) were assessed in 3 HIV infected individuals in presence and absence of valproate (Depakine enteric; 30 mg/kg, divided in two daily oral doses administered during 14 days).

Subjects in study arms on dolutegravir without valproate served as controls. Total dolutegravir trough levels (mean Â± SD) prior and after valproate 2.1 Â± 1.4 mg/L on day 0 and 1.6 Â± 0.67 mg/L on day 42.

Conversely, the free fraction of dolutegravir increased from 0.29-0.30% without valproate administration to 0.54-0.7% during valproate coadministration. Importantly, all free dolutegravir concentrations were above the proposed in vitro EC90 value of unbound dolutegravir (0.9 Âµg/L). This study demonstrates that the reported decreased in total dolutegravir concentrations with concomitant use of valproate is due to protein displacement.
