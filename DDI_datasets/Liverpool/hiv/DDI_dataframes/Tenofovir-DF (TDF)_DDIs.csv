When coadministered with tenofovir-DF, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. Tenofovir-DF should not be coadministered with atazanavir without ritonavir. Patients receiving tenofovir-DF concomitantly with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Tenofovir-DF should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc., February 2016.Atazanavir trough concentrations were determined in 43 HIV+ subjects receiving unboosted atazanavir (400 mg once daily) in the presence of tenofovir-DF. The median trough concentration was 242 (range 106-1100) ng/ml with 8 subjects having low trough concentrations (<150 ng/ml). Following a dose increase to 600 mg once daily in 4/8 subjects, atazanavir trough concentrations were 222-294 ng/ml. Viral load results were available for 36 subjects, 31 of whom were undetectable (<50 copies/ml) at baseline. 30 remained <50 copies/ml and all were <100 copies/ml at last follow up. Five subjects had viral loads >50 copies/ml at baseline, of whom 3 were undetectable at last follow up. Atazanavir trough levels in patients receiving unboosted atazanavir and tenofovir. Harris M, Hull M, Toy J, et al. 10th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Amsterdam, April 2009, abstract P21.The pharmacokinetic effects of the coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and unboosted atazanavir were studied in HIV-negative subjects. A dosing strategy that would provide atazanavir and tenofovir exposures comparable to each drug when dosed alone was evaluated. The strategies employed were dosing the ATV (400 mg once daily) and TDF 12 hours apart and increasing the ATV dose to 600 mg once daily. The temporal 12-hour separation of ATV 400 mg resulted in a decrease in ATV Cmax, AUC, Cmin of 10%, 17%, and 28%, respectively and an increase in TDF Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 43%, 37%, and 38%, respectively. The simultaneous administration of 600 mg ATV with TDF resulted in a decrease in ATV Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 27%, 36%, and 41%, respectively and an increase in TDF Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 41%, 59%, and 74%, respectively. Based on these findings the authors continue to recommend that when co-dosed with TDF, ATV (300 mg once daily) should be combined with RTV (100 mg once daily). Pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and atazanavir in healthy subjects.

57,Tenofovir-DF (TDF),Atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c),Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. The combination of tenofovir-DF (300 mg) and atazanavir (400 mg) reduced atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 25%, 21% and 40%, respectively, but increased tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 24%, 14% and 22%, respectively. Atazanavir/cobicistat is also expected to increase tenofovir plasma concentrations. Patients should be closely monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse events, including renal disorders. The European SmPC recommends that atazanavir/cobicistat and tenofovir be given together with food. Cobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting actual renal glomerular function. Atazanavir/cobicistat should not be coadministered with emtricitabine in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 ml/min.","Tenofovir DF may decrease the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir. When co-administered with tenofovir DF, it is recommended that Evotaz and tenofovir DF 300 mg be given together with food. Atazanavir increases tenofovir concentrations. Higher concentrations could potentiate tenofovir-associated adverse reactions, including renal disorders. Patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg, once daily) with atazanavir (400 mg, once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 25%, 21% and 40%, respectively; tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 24%, 14% and 22%, respectively. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF with cobicistat is expected to increase tenofovir plasma concentrations (AUC and Cmin increased by 23% and 55%). The mechanism of interaction between atazanavir and tenofovir-DF is unknown. Cobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting actual renal glomerular function. Evotaz should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 ml/min if any coadministered agent (e.g. tenofovir disoproxil) requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance.Evotaz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, November 2018.Coadministration may decrease atazanavir exposure and increase tenofovir concentrations. Patients receiving Evotaz and tenofovir should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome, has been reported when cobicistat was used in an antiretroviral regimen that contained tenofovir-DF. Therefore, coadministration of Evotaz and tenofovir-DF is not recommended in patients who have an estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL/min. When Evotaz is used with tenofovir-DF, document urine glucose and urine protein at baseline and perform routine monitoring of estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein during treatment. Measure serum phosphorus in patients at risk for renal impairment. Coadministration of Evotaz and tenofovir-DF in combination with concomitant or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent is not recommended. Evotaz US Prescribing Information Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2018."
58,Tenofovir-DF (TDF),Atazanavir + ritonavir (ATV/r),Potential Interaction,Moderate,"In a combined analysis of several clinical studies with tenofovir-DF (300 mg) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg), atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 22%, 16% and 23%, respectively, and tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 37%, 34% and 29%, respectively. Patients should be closely monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse events, including renal disorders. A dose increase to atazanavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg with TDM may be considered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. If atazanavir/ritonavir with tenofovir-DF OR an H2-receptor antagonist are coadministered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, a dose increase to atazanavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg is recommended. It is not recommended to use atazanavir with ritonavir for pregnant patients who are receiving both tenofovir-DF AND an H2-receptor antagonist.","In a combined analysis from several clinical studies, atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (n=39) was compared to atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg (n=33). Atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased 22%, 16% and 23%, respectively. Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg once daily) was studied in healthy volunteers. Tenofovir-DF AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased 37%, 34% and 29%, respectively. The mechanism of interaction between atazanavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is unknown. The efficacy of Reyataz/ritonavir in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in treatment-experienced patients has been demonstrated in clinical study 045 and in treatment naive patients in clinical study 138. When coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, it is recommended that Reyataz 300 mg be given with ritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (all as a single dose with food). Patients should be closely monitored for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-associated adverse reactions, including renal disorders. Reyataz given without ritonavir should not be considered in patients treated with a backbone regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil.Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, October 2018.Tenofovir DF may decrease the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir. When coadministered with tenofovir DF in adults, it is recommended that Reyataz 300 mg be given with ritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir DF 300 mg (all as a single daily dose with food). Reyataz increases tenofovir concentrations. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher tenofovir concentrations could potentiate tenofovir-associated adverse reactions, including renal disorders. Patients receiving Reyataz and tenofovir DF should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg, once daily) with atazanavir (400 mg, once daily) was studied in 34 healthy volunteers. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased 21%, 25% and 40%, respectively. Tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased 14%, 24%, and 22%, respectively (n=33). Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg, once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily) was studied in 12 healthy volunteers. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased 28%, 25% and 23%, respectively (n=10). Tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased 34%, 37% and 29%, respectively. Note that similar results were observed in studies where administration of tenofovir DF and Reyataz was separated by 12 hours. Atazanavir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg results in higher atazanavir exposure than atazanavir 400 mg. The geometric mean values of atazanavir pharmacokinetic parameters when coadministered with ritonavir and tenofovir DF were: Cmax = 3190 ng/mL, AUC = 34459 ng.h/mL, and Cmin = 491 ng/mL. Study was conducted in HIV-infected individuals.Reyataz US Prescribing Information Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2018.Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC (25%), Cmax (28%) and Cmin (26%). Tenofovir AUC increased by 37%, Cmax increased by 34% and Cmin increased by 29%. No dose adjustment is recommended. The increased exposure of tenofovir could potentiate tenofovir-associated adverse events, including renal disorders. Renal function should be closely monitored.Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, September 2016.Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily for 14 days) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) to 33 subjects increased tenofovir Cmax (14%), AUC (24%) and Cmin (22%). Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 21%, 25% and 40% respectively. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily for 42 days) increased tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 34%, 37% and 29%, respectively; atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 28%, 25%, and 23%, respectively. In HIV-infected patients, the addition of tenofovir-DF to atazanavir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg, resulted in AUC and Cmin values of atazanavir that were 2.3- and 4-fold higher than the respective values observed for atazanavir 400 mg when given alone. When coadministered with tenofovir-DF, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. Tenofovir-DF should not be coadministered with atazanavir without ritonavir. Patients receiving tenofovir-DF concomitantly with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Tenofovir-DF should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, February 2016.Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg, once daily) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, once daily, with NRTIs) was studied in 20 HIV positive patients. Atazanavir Cmin decreased 3% and Cmax and AUC increased 7% and 8%, respectively. These differences are not statistically significant. Tenofovir comedication does not impair the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir in HIV-1-infected adults. von Hentig N, Dauer B, Haberl A et al., Eur J Clin Pharmacol, 2007, 63(10): 935-940.A study was performed in healthy volunteers to determine whether increasing ATV/RTV from 300/100 mg to 400/100 mg once daily with TDF or maintaining the standard dose but separating administration of TDF by 12 h, could overcome the 25% decrease in ATV exposure previously seen when coadministered with TDF. Relative to ATV/RTV 300/100, simultaneous administration of ATV/RTV 400/100 resulted in increases in ATV AUC and Cmin of 38% and 33% respectively. TDF AUC and Cmin increased by 55% and 70% respectively. Maintaining the standard dose, but separating administration by 12 h, resulted in an 11% decrease in ATV AUC and a 20% decrease in Cmin. TDF AUC and Cmin increased by 37% and 29% respectively. RTV exposure was comparable across treatments. Due to the increases in ATV and higher TDF exposures, coadministration of ATV/RTV 400/100 mg with TDF is not recommended. Separation of ATV/RTV 300/100 mg and TDF doses are not expected to offer any additional clinical advantage over simultaneous administration. Pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and atazanavir coadministered with ritonavir in healthy subjects. Agarwala, S et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 16.The pharmacokinetics of TDF (300 mg once daily), when given with ATV/RTV (300/100 mg once daily), were assessed in a substudy of the Puzzle2-ANRS 107 trial. Full PK profiles were determined in 10 patients: median (range) TDF Cmax, Cmin and AUC were 234 (121-855) ng/ml, 45 (23-215) ng/ml and 2253 (1305-11285) ng/ml.h respectively. Trough concentrations at weeks 6, 10, 18 and 26 were 58, 64, 53 and 57 ng/ml respectively (n=32-38). Tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable to historical data obtained from healthy and HIV+ subjects, suggesting that tenofovir exposure is not substantially altered when coadministered with atazanavir/ritonavir. Pharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir when combined with atazanavir /ritonavir in HIV infected patients with multiple treatment failures: a substudy of Puzzle2- ANRS 107 trial.

Atazanavir Cmax, Cmin and AUC decreased ~34%, ~33% and ~27%, respectively. The decrease in AUC is the only PK parameter which reached significance. No significant correlation between the decreased atazanavir exposure and the viral response was seen.Interactions between atazanavir-ritonavir and tenofovir in heavily pretreated human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Taburet AM, Piketty C, Chazallon C et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2004, 48(6): 2091-2096.Steady-state atazanavir concentrations were assessed in HIV+ patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with and without tenofovir-DF and/or nevirapine. No significant difference was observed in atazanavir concentrations for patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir alone and those taking tenofovir-DF. There was a trend towards decreased atazanavir concentrations for patients co-dosed with nevirapine (with or without tenofovir). These results from a clinical setting suggest that ritonavir boosting of atazanavir reduces the interaction with tenofovir; however, it may not overcome interactions with nevirapine. Interaction between atazanavir/ritonavir and nevirapine is observed in a clinical setting.

When compared to controls, buprenorphine had no statistically significant effect on NRTI concentrations.","Coadministration of buprenorphine (14-16 mg once daily, stable dose with naloxone) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) was studied in 10 opioid-dependent patients and values compared to 10 matched controls receiving tenofovir-DF alone. Coadministration had no significant effect on buprenorphine (AUC and Cmax increased by ~5% and ~9%, Cmin was unchanged) or its metabolites (norbuprenorphine AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by ~7%, ~4% and ~1%, respectively; buprenorphine-3-glucuronide AUC and Cmin decreased by ~14% and ~9%, Cmax increased by ~9%; norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide AUC increased by ~1%, Cmax decreased by ~3% and Cmin was unchanged).

Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk of didanosine-related adverse events. Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) didanosine.

Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. When administered with tenofovir-DF, Cmax and AUC of didanosine increased significantly. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir-DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. In patients weighing greater than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg once daily when it is coadministered with tenofovir-DF. In patients weighing less than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 200 mg once daily when it is coadministered with tenofovir-DF.

Co-administration of didanosine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk for didanosine-related adverse events. Rare cases of pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. A reduced didanosine dose (250 mg) has been tested to avoid over-exposure to didanosine in case of co-administration with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, but this has been associated with reports of high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at early stage within several tested combinations. Co-administration of didanosine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is therefore not recommended, especially in patients with high viral load and low CD4 cell count. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) didanosine.

There were no significant differences in ddA-TP or TDF-DP when didanosine or tenofovir were administered alone or in combination. This study does not support the existence of a strong intracellular interaction between didanosine and tenofovir, but can not conclude that there is absolutely no interaction due to small sample size. As ddA-TP concentrations were similar when didanosine given alone (400 mg) or at a reduced dose (250 mg) with tenofovir, the study supports the dose adaptation proposed for this combination.

HIV Med, 2010,11(3): 193-199.This study was a prospective phase I crossover study in 30 healthy volunteers who received fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/100 or 1400/200 mg once daily) with or without tenofovir (300 mg once daily) for 14 days. Tenofovir was added or discontinued (cross over) for another 14 days, with pharmacokinetics being assessed on days 14 and 28. There was no effect of tenofovir on amprenavir AUC or Cmax in either regimen. Tenofovir led to significant increases in ritonavir AUC (32%) and Cmax (71%) when given with fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/200 mg. However, the authors conclude that no dose modification is necessary when combining fosamprenavir/ritonavir with tenofovir. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir plus tenofovir does not affect amprenavir pharmacokinetics: no effect of tenofovir. Kurowski M, Walli RK, Breske A, et al. AIDS, 2007, 21(10): 1368-1370. The interaction between TDF (300 mg once daily) and FPV/RTV (1400/100 mg or 1400/200 mg once daily) was investigated in healthy male subjects. The 24 h PK profiles for APV were similar for the two groups. There was no effect of TDF on APV AUC in either the 100 mg (GMR=0.99) or 200 mg (GMR=1.06) RTV groups. APV Cmax was unaffected by TDF in the 100 mg group (GMR=1.04), whereas the 200 mg group showed a non-significant increase (GMR=1.11). APV Ctrough showed non-significant increases in both groups (100 mg GMR=1.24, 200 mg GMR=1.02). There was a non-significant trend to higher RTV AUC in the 200 mg group. TDF monophosphate AUC and Cmax showed a non-significant trend to being lower in the 200 mg group, but with a higher Ctrough. Coadministration of TDF with FPV/RTV was generally well tolerated and the absence of relevant interactions suggests that no dose modification is necessary. Coadministration of tenofovir 300 mg once daily with fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/100 mg once daily or 1400/200 mg once daily does not affect amprenavir pharmacokinetics. Kurowski, M et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 10.The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of the FPV/RTV-TDF interaction in HIV+ patients (n=21) receiving FPV/RTV (700/100 mg twice daily) in combination with TDF (300 mg once daily). Median (range) trough concentrations were 1586 (867-2925) ng/ml for APV, 166 (30-615) ng/ml for RTV and 64 (31-226) ng/ml for TDF. Trough concentrations were in the adequate ranges and no clinically relevant PK interaction was found.Plasma concentrations of amprenavir, ritonavir and tenofovir in HIV-infected patients treated with fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg BID) and tenofovir (300 mg QD) containing regimen.

This study looked at the interaction at the intracellular level by investigating the effect of LPV/RTV (400/100 once daily) on TDF-DP concentrations in HIV+ patients taking TDF (300 mg once daily). There was a trend to higher TDF-DP concentrations when used in combination with LPV/r. However, due to interpatient variability, this did not reach statistical significance. Mean ± SD TDF-DP concentrations were 181.4 ± 80.1 and 280.3 ± 181.8 fmol/106 cells, alone and in combination with LPV/RTV respectively.

Tenofovir-DF is predominantly eliminated unchanged via active renal tubular secretion, however unless treatment with ascorbic acid involves large doses of prolonged duration, significant interactions are not expected.",(See Summary)
758,Tenofovir-DF (TDF),Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. There is little potential for an interaction with tenofovir-DF via modulation of, or competition for, metabolic pathways.",(See Summary)
759,Tenofovir-DF (TDF),Phytomenadione (Vitamin K) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Metabolism of phytomenadione is thought to involve CYP4F2 and glucuronidation. Renal elimination of phytomenadione is minimal, therefore, there is little potential for an interaction with tenofovir-DF via competition for renal elimination pathways.",(See Summary)
760,Tenofovir-DF (TDF),Nicotinamide (Niacinamide) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Nicotinamide is metabolized by nicotinamide methyltransferase to N-methylnicotinamide which is then metabolized by xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase. Renal elimination of unchanged nicotinamide is minimal, therefore, there is little potential for an interaction with tenofovir-DF via competition for renal elimination pathways.",(See Summary)
