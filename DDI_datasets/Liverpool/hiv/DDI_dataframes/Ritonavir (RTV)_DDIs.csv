3,Ritonavir (RTV),Acenocoumarol,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Case report of a decrease in INR after starting FULL DOSE ritonavir (600 mg twice daily). The previous INR was unattainable even with a 3-fold increase in acenocoumarol dose and ritonavir was withdrawn. ,"A case has been reported of a clinically severe interaction between full dose ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) and acenocoumarol. A patient stable on acenocoumarol therapy started stavudine, lamivudine and full dose ritonavir and his INR decreased. Despite a three-fold increase in acenocounarol dose it was impossible to achieve the previous INR and ritonavir was withdrawn.Severe interaction between ritonavir and acenocoumarol.

4,Ritonavir (RTV),Acetazolamide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acetazolamide is primarily excreted unchanged via the kidneys, there is therefore little potential for interaction with ritonavir via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.",(See Summary)
5,Ritonavir (RTV),Aciclovir (Acyclovir),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as aciclovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1.,(See Summary)
6,Ritonavir (RTV),Acitretin,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as acitretin undergoes isomerisation and glucuronidation.",(See Summary)
7,Ritonavir (RTV),Aclidinium bromide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aclidinium bromide is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed (non-enzymatic and enzymatic transformation by esterases and butylrylcholineesterases) to its pharmacologically inactive metabolites with only a minor role for CYP metabolism.,(See Summary)
8,Ritonavir (RTV),Adalimumab,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Adalimumab is a monoclonal IgG antibody. Elimination is similar to endogenous IgG and occurs primarily via proteolytic catabolism throughout the body.,(See Summary)
9,Ritonavir (RTV),Adefovir,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as adefovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1. ,(See Summary)
10,Ritonavir (RTV),Adrenaline (Epinephrine),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated, mostly in the liver by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). There is therefore little potential for interaction with ritonavir via modulation of, or competition for metabolic or elimination pathways.",(See Summary)
11,Ritonavir (RTV),African Potato,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolic data there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. African potato was shown to inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp in vitro and to activate PXR suggesting that inhibition may occur initially followed by induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp when used for extended periods. However, coadministration of African potato with lopinavir/ritonavir in healthy volunteers did not result in significant pharmacokinetic changes suggesting that boosting by ritonavir could offset the inducing effect of African potato. Similarly, no significant effect is expected on the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir.",(See Summary)
12,Ritonavir (RTV),Agomelatine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Agomelatine is metabolised predominantly by CYP1A2 which is induced by ritonavir. Coadministration could potentially decrease agomelatine exposure. Monitor clinical effect and increase dosage if needed.,(See Summary)
13,Ritonavir (RTV),Albendazole,Potential Interaction,Moderate,"In vitro studies suggest that albendazole is predominantly metabolised by CYP450 enzymes, including CYP3A4. In a clinical study in 8 healthy volunteers, steady state ritonavir (200 mg twice daily) decreased albendazole and the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide AUC (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Co-administration may cause a reduction in the clinical effect of albendazole.","In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and  its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

14,Ritonavir (RTV),Albuvirtide,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Albuvirtide is a peptide which is eliminated by catabolism to its constituent amino acids. Based on data from studies with lopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations of ritonavir decrease but this is not expected to be clinically relevant. Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. However, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone (lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 37%, 33% and 35%, respectively; ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 38%, 39% and 28%, respectively). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 µg/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy. Furthermore, a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study) showed that albuvirtide + lopinavir/ritonavir was non-inferior to the standard second-line regimen lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine in HIV infected Chinese individuals suggesting that this interaction has no clinical consequences. In vitro human microsomal studies indicate that albuvirtide has no inducing properties on P450 enzymes. In addition, albuvirtide binds to <1% of serum albumin in the range of clinical concentrations, thus the observed decrease in lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations is unlikely to result from protein binding displacement. However, binding of the albuvirtide-albumin complex to the HIV protease inhibitor cannot be excluded.","Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 9 HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. Conversely, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone. The mean ratios (90% CI) of AUC, Cmax and Ctrough for lopinavir were 0.63 (0.49-0.82), 0.67 (053-0.86) and 0.65 (0.46-0.91). For ritonavir, AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 0.62 (0.42-0.91), 0.61 (0.38-0.99) and 0.72 (0.40-1.26). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 ug/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy.Evaluation of pharmacokinetic interactions between long-acting HIV-1 fusion inhibitor albuvirtide and lopinavir/ritonavir, in HIV-infected subjects, combined with clinical study and simulation results.

Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive albuvirtide (once weekly) plus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (albuvirtide) or WHO-recommended second-line treatment (lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine; control). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma viral load <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Non-inferiority was pre-specified with a margin of 12%. Interim analysis of 48 week data from 46 subjects in the albuvirtide group and 50 patients in the control group showed 80.4% patients in the albuvirtide group had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL versus 66.0% in the control group (difference 14.4%, 95% CI -3.0% -31.9%), meeting the non-inferiority criteria.Efficacy and safety of long-acting HIV fusion inhibitor albuvirtide in antiretroviral-experienced adults with HIV-1: interim 48-week results from the randomized, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority TALENT study.

17,Ritonavir (RTV),Alendronic Acid,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"If taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product.",(See Summary)
18,Ritonavir (RTV),Alfentanil,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Alfentanil undergoes extensive CYP3A4 metabolism.

20,Ritonavir (RTV),Aliskiren,Do Not Coadminister,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Aliskiren is minimally metabolized by CYP450, however, P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren bioavailability. A 5-6 fold increase in exposure was observed with itraconazole 100 mg twice daily (a CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) and a similar interaction is possible with ritonavir (due to inhibition of P-gp by ritonavir). The product labels for aliskiren recommend avoiding concomitant use with CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors.",(See Summary)
21,Ritonavir (RTV),Allopurinol,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as allopurinol is converted to oxipurinol by xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase. ,(See Summary)
22,Ritonavir (RTV),Almotriptan,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Almotriptan is partly eliminated unchanged in the urine and partly metabolized (mainly via monoamine oxidase-A and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and flavin monooxygenase). Although coadministration may increase almotriptan concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 this is unlikely to be of clinical significance.",(See Summary)
23,Ritonavir (RTV),Aloe vera,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aloe vera is only a weak inhibitor of CYPs in vitro and therefore is unlikely to cause clinically significant interactions. It does not inhibit P-gp and there is no evidence to suggest it impacts UGTs.",(See Summary)
24,Ritonavir (RTV),Alosetron,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro data indicate that alosetron is metabolized by CYPs 2C9 (30%), 3A4 (18%) and 1A2 (10%); however, in vivo data suggest that CYP1A2 plays a more prominent role. In vitro data indicate that ritonavir induces CYP1A2, and coadministration could potentially decrease alosetron exposure.",(See Summary)
25,Ritonavir (RTV),Alprazolam,Potential Interaction,High,"Alprazolam metabolism was inhibited following the introduction of ritonavir (2.5-fold increase in AUC), but at steady state no significant inhibitory effect was observed (12% decrease in AUC). Caution is warranted during the first few days of coadministration, before induction of alprazolam metabolism develops.","Coadministration of alprazolam (1 mg single dose) and ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 2 days) increased alprazolam AUC by 2.5-fold but had no effect on Cmin. Coadministration with ritonavir (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) decreased alprazolam AUC by 12% and Cmin by 16%. Alprazolam metabolism was inhibited following the introduction of ritonavir. After ritonavir use for 10 days, no inhibitory effect of ritonavir was observed. Caution is warranted during the first several days when alprazolam is co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, before induction of alprazolam metabolism develops. Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, September 2016.Coadministration of ritonavir (500 mg every 12 hours for 10 days) with a single dose of alprazolam, in 12 subjects caused a 12% and 16% decrease in alprazolam AUC and Cmax, respectively. Norvir Prescribing Information, AbbVie Inc, December 2016.Following coadministration of ritonavir (500 mg 12 hourly) and a single dose of alprazolam (1 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers, it was found that alprazolam AUC was reduced by 12% and alprazolam Cmax was reduced by 16% in the presence of ritonavir. Ritonavir AUC was in the expected range. Modification of the alprazolam dose in patients receiving ritonavir is unnecessary. Contraindication of alprazolam and ritonavir is unwarranted. Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam Frye R, Bertz R, Granneman GR, et al. 37th International Conference on Antimicrobial Agents & Chemotherapy, 1997, abstract A-59.Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg 12 hourly, 4 doses) and alprazolam (1 mg single dose) was investigated in 10 healthy volunteers. Coadministration of ritonavir produced a highly significant prolongation of alprazolam elimination half-life, an increase in AUC and a 41% decrease in clearance. The findings emphasise the complex time dependent consequences of ritonavir co-treatment on the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam.

33,Ritonavir (RTV),Amitriptyline,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Amitriptyline is metabolised predominantly by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic booster is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 and therefore might increase amitriptyline exposure, although to a moderate extent. No a priori dosage adjustment is recommended if ritonavir is dosed as a pharmacokinetic booster, however, careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended with full dose ritonavir.","Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is likely to inhibit CYP2D6 and as a result is expected to increase concentrations of amitriptyline.

34,Ritonavir (RTV),Amlodipine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Amlodipine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and ritonavir is predicted to increase amlodipine exposure by ~2-fold based on drug-drug interactions studies with amlodipine and indinavir/ritonavir or paritaprevir/ritonavir. If coadministration is indicated, consider a dose reduction for amlodipine of 50%. Close monitoring is recommended.","Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of calcium channel antagonists. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when these medicines are concomitantly administered with ritonavir.

Because of previous  bilateral cytomegalovirus retinitis, complicated by immune recovery  uveitis with severe, chronic, cystoid macular oedema, she was also using  dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops six times daily, and betamethasone 0.1%  eye ointment at night, in both eyes. On examination, she was noted to  have central adiposity and enlargement of the dorsocervical fat, but no  peripheral lipoatrophy. An MRI scan of the hip showed avascular  necrosis. A tetracosactide (Synacthen) stimulation test showed marked  suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis, with a baseline cortisol of  less than 25 nmol/L rising to only 37 nmol/l 30 min after administration  of tetracosactide 250mg (normal response at 30 min, >570 nmol/L).  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was undetectable. The presence of  adrenal axis suppression with low ACTH, in the context of Cushingoid  features and avascular necrosis of the hip, suggested ongoing exposure  to high systemic levels of exogenous corticosteroids. Ritonavir and  atazanavir were substituted with efavirenz (600 mg once daily), while  continuing the steroid eye drops. Oral hydrocortisone 15 mg daily was  added to avoid precipitating crisis due to adrenal insufficiency. Over  the following year, the patient’s weight declined, with marked  improvement in her adrenal function. Analysis of stored serum samples  revealed elevated levels of dexamethasone at presentation (1.4-1.7  nmol/L) which fell dramatically after discontinuation of protease  inhibitor therapy (undetectable to 0.181 nmol/L). Although prior courses  of oral and intravenous corticosteroids may have contributed to adrenal  axis suppression, the close temporal correlation between  discontinuation of ritonavir, reversal of weight gain and recovery of  adrenal function, combined with detectable levels of dexamethasone in  the blood, strongly suggests that co-administration of ritonavir was  responsible for the accumulation of excessive systemic levels of topical  ocular corticosteroids, resulting in adrenal axis suppression and  Cushing’s syndrome.Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal axis  suppression in a patient treated with ritonavir and corticosteroid eye  drops.

Coadministration of bictegravir and darunavir/cobicistat increased bictegravir AUC by 74%. A comparable increase in bictegravir exposure is anticipated when coadministered with darunavir/ritonavir. This increase is unlikely to be clinically significant; available dose exposure data, as well as data from phase 2 and phase 3 studies (48 weeks treatment), have shown a good safety profile with up to a 2.4 fold increase in bictegravir AUC. However, darunavir/ritonavir increases tenofovir alafenamide (the prodrug of tenofovir) due to inhibition of intestinal P-gp thereby increasing the systemic concentration.

Prior to starting ritonavir (400 mg bd) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily), the patient was stable on carbamazepine 600 mg/day, with carbamazepine concentrations of 6.9 µg/ml (therapeutic range 4–12 µg/ml). Four days after starting the ART regimen, the patient was hospitalised with a one day history of worsening ataxia resulting in two falls; serum carbamazepine concentrations were found to be 20.4 µg/ml. Carbamazepine was discontinued for 9 days and restarted at 300 mg/day, however, over the next 3 weeks it was necessary to further reduce the carbamazepine dose to 100 mg/day. The patient remained stable on this dose for approximately 2 weeks, when it became necessary to discontinue her ART regimen. Following the withdrawal of ritonavir and efavirenz, it was found that carbamazepine concentrations were subtherapeutic requiring an increase in carbamazepine dose back to the original 600 mg/day. The authors had not expected a marked increase in carbamazepine concentrations as the change in the ART regimen involved changing from indinavir to ritonavir (a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor), but at the same time adding in a relatively potent inducer of CYP3A4 (efavirenz).

When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity.

128,Ritonavir (RTV),Ciclesonide,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Ciclesonide can be administered with ritonavir without dose adjustment, but with close monitoring. There is a risk of steroid side effects occurring, particularly if a high dose is used, or in case of prolonged administration, or if used with another medicine containing corticosteroids. These side effects are also more likely during periods of physiological stress. Ciclesonide is a pro-drug activated by esterases in the lungs to des-ciclesonide which then undergoes CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 7 days) with orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 µg once daily) did not alter ciclesonide but resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the AUC and a 2-fold increase in the Cmax of des-ciclesonide. Ciclesonide is mainly absorbed by the lungs, has a high protein binding and a high clearance resulting in a lower potential to cause systemic effects compared to some other inhaled corticosteroids. Hence, any interaction with ritonavir would not require any dosage/therapy adjustments, particularly if ciclesonide is administered at lower or medium clinical doses, but close monitoring for Cushing’s syndrome signs is required when using a higher dose or with prolonged administration. ",(See Summary)

149,Ritonavir (RTV),Clopidogrel,Do Not Coadminister,Low,"Coadministration of clopidogrel and boosted regimens has been evaluated in clinical studies. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite both by 69% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). In HIV-negative subjects (n=12), coadministration of clopidogrel and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 51% and 48%. Importantly, the decrease in clopidogrel’s active metabolite lead to insufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation in 44% of the patients treated with clopidogrel and ritonavir or cobicistat. Consistently, the study in HIV-negative subjects showed that the average inhibition of platelet aggregation was decreased from 51% (clopidogrel alone) to 31% (clopidogrel + ritonavir). Of interest, the study with HIV-infected patients showed a comparable decrease in prasugrel’s active metabolite AUC (52% decrease), however this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. The differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect is in line with clinical observations. Early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Taken together these data suggest that given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites.

Ritonavir significantly decreased the exposure of clopidogrel AM by 51% and average platelet inhibition significantly decreased from 51% without ritonavir to 31% with ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -27% to -12%). The maximal platelet inhibition by clopidogrel was also reduced from 60% to 40% during concurrent ritonavir (mean difference 90% CI -29% to -11%).

163,Ritonavir (RTV),Dabigatran,Potential Interaction,Low,"Coadministration of dabigatran (150 mg single dose) simultaneously with or 2 h before ritonavir alone (100 mg once daily administered at steady state) was studied in HIV negative subjects. Simultaneous administration did not significantly change dabigatran PK (possibly due to mixed induction and inhibition of P-gp by ritonavir as dabigatran is a substrate of P-gp). Administration 2 hours before ritonavir decreased dabigatran AUC by 29% and Cmax by 27% (n=16). These results suggests that dabigatran can be administered simultaneously with ritonavir when used once daily as a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with no renal impairment, though no data are available when ritonavir is used twice daily as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Data with verapamil (a P-gp inhibitor) and dabigatran suggest caution is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment as the dabigatran dose might need to be reduced in presence of a P-gp inhibitor such as ritonavir. Note, dabigatran is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment.","Coadministration of dabigatran (150 mg single dose) with ritonavir (100 mg, once daily, n=16) was studied in healthy volunteers in a cross-over study. Dabigatran was given either 2 hours before or simultaneously with ritonavir. There were no statistically significant changes to dabigatran AUC or Cmax when dabigatran was coadministered simultaneously with ritonavir. However, dabigatran AUC and Cmax decreased by 29% and 27%, respectively, when coadministered separately to ritonavir. There were no significant changes to thrombin time in either arm of the ritonavir study. The authors hypothesise that no significant effect on dabigatran pharmacokinetics was seen with ritonavir due to its mixed induction and inhibitory effect on P-gp.Differential influence of the antiretroviral pharmacokinetic enhancers ritonavir and cobicistat on intestinal P-glycoprotein transport and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic disposition of dabigatran.

In individuals with normal renal function, predicted Ctrough were within dabigatran therapeutic range (28-210 ng/ml) when dabigatran was administered concurrently with or 2 hours before verapamil at a dose of 150 mg twice daily. However, Ctrough was below the lower limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered at 110 mg twice daily 2 hours before verapamil but still within the therapeutic range in case of simultaneous administration. In individuals with mild renal impairment, predicted Ctrough exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered concurrently or 2 hours before verapamil at a dose of 150 mg twice daily but were within the therapeutic range when administered at a dose of 110 mg twice daily. In individuals with moderate renal impairment, predicted Ctrough exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered concurrently with and 2 hours before verapamil at a dose of 110 mg twice daily but were within the therapeutic range when administered at a dose of 75 mg twice daily. Finally, in individuals with severe renal impairment, predicted Ctrough exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered concurrently with verapamil at a dose of 75 mg twice daily. This study indicates that dabigatran dosage in presence of a P-gp inhibitor such as verapamil varies depending on the renal function. These results suggest that, when coadministered with verapamil, one (110 mg twice daily) and two-stage (75 mg twice daily) reductions of the dabigatran dose are required for individuals with mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively.Assessing potential drug-drug interactions between dabigatran etexilate and a P-gp inhibitor in renal impairment population using PBPK modeling.

Use with caution. Adrenal axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome was reported in a woman receiving atazanavir/ritonavir, tenofovir and emtricitabine with dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops six times daily. Elevated levels of dexamethasone were measured at presentation (1.4-1.7 nmol/L) which fell dramatically after discontinuation of protease inhibitor therapy (undetectable to 0.181 nmol/L).

Because of previous bilateral cytomegalovirus retinitis, complicated by immune recovery uveitis with severe, chronic, cystoid macular oedema, she was also using dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops six times daily, and betamethasone 0.1% eye ointment at night, in both eyes. On examination, she was noted to have central adiposity and enlargement of the dorsocervical fat, but no peripheral lipoatrophy. An MRI scan of the hip showed avascular necrosis. A tetracosactide (Synacthen) stimulation test showed marked suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis, with a baseline cortisol of less than 25 nmol/L rising to only 37 nmol/l 30 min after administration of tetracosactide 250mg (normal response at 30 min, >570 nmol/L). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was undetectable. The presence of adrenal axis suppression with low ACTH, in the context of Cushingoid features and avascular necrosis of the hip, suggested ongoing exposure to high systemic levels of exogenous corticosteroids. Ritonavir and atazanavir were substituted with efavirenz (600 mg once daily), while continuing the steroid eye drops. Oral hydrocortisone 15 mg daily was added to avoid precipitating crisis due to adrenal insufficiency. Over the following year, the patient’s weight declined, with marked improvement in her adrenal function. Analysis of stored serum samples revealed elevated levels of dexamethasone at presentation (1.4-1.7 nmol/L) which fell dramatically after discontinuation of protease inhibitor therapy (undetectable to 0.181 nmol/L). Although prior courses of oral and intravenous corticosteroids may have contributed to adrenal axis suppression, the close temporal correlation between discontinuation of ritonavir, reversal of weight gain and recovery of adrenal function, combined with detectable levels of dexamethasone in the blood, strongly suggests that co-administration of ritonavir was responsible for the accumulation of excessive systemic levels of topical ocular corticosteroids, resulting in adrenal axis suppression and Cushing’s syndrome.Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal axis suppression in a patient treated with ritonavir and corticosteroid eye drops.

Patients starting ritonavir whilst already on digoxin, should have their digoxin dose halved and their digoxin concentrations monitored. The impact on the PR interval of coadministration of ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (including beta-adrenergic blockers) has not been evaluated. Clinical monitoring is recommended.","Coadministration of ritonavir (300 mg twice daily for three days) and a single IV dose of digoxin (0.5 mg) increased digoxin AUC by 86%. Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 13 days) and a single ORAL dose of digoxin (0.4 mg) increased digoxin AUC by 22% and had no effect on Cmax. Particular caution should be used when prescribing ritonavir in patients taking digoxin since co-administration of ritonavir with digoxin is expected to increase digoxin levels. The increased digoxin levels may lessen over time. In patients who are already taking digoxin when ritonavir is introduced, the digoxin dose should be reduced to one-half of the patients' normal dose and patients need to be followed more closely than usual for several weeks after initiating co-administration of ritonavir and digoxin. In patients who are already taking ritonavir when digoxin is introduced, digoxin should be introduced more gradually than usual. Digoxin levels should be monitored more intensively than usual during this period, with dose adjustments made, as necessary, based on clinical, electrocardiographic and digoxin level findings. Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, September 2016.Concomitant administration of ritonavir with digoxin may increase digoxin levels. Caution should be exercised when coadministering ritonavir with digoxin, with appropriate monitoring of serum digoxin levels. The impact on the PR interval of co-administration of ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (including digoxin) has not been evaluated. As a result, co-administration of ritonavir with these drugs should be undertaken with caution, particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Clinical monitoring is recommended.Norvir Prescribing Information, AbbVie Inc, December 2016.The pharmacokinetics of digoxin were determined in 12 healthy volunteers following a single dose of digoxin (0.4 mg orally) before and after 14 days of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily). Ritonavir increased digoxin AUC(0-72) from 26.20 ± 8.67 to 31.96 ± 11.24 ng.h/mL and AUC(0-8) from 6.25 ± 1.8 to 8.04 ± 2.22 ng.h/mL. Digoxin oral clearance decreased from 149 ± 101 to 105 ± 57 mL/h.kg. Other digoxin pharmacokinetics, including renal clearance, were unaffected by ritonavir. Overall, 75% (9/12) of subjects had higher concentrations of digoxin after ritonavir administration. The most likely mechanism for this interaction is ritonavir-associated inhibition of P-gp. Ritonavir decreases the nonrenal clearance of digoxin in healthy volunteers with known MDR1 genotypes. Penzak SR, Shen JM, Alfaro RM, et al.

199,Ritonavir (RTV),Docetaxel,Potential Interaction,Low,"Coadministration with ritonavir may increase concentrations of docetaxel and increase the risk of severe toxicities. There have been several case reports of severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity when coadministered with ritonavir, a potent CYP3A inhibitor. Ideally avoid coadministration with boosted protease inhibitors or consider using an alternative taxane. ","Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. Taxotere (docetaxel) Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-Aventis, December 2009.Three cases have been reported where administration of IV docetaxel to HIV+ patients on ritonavir-containing regimens resulted in severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity 3-7 days after the first infusion of docetaxel (70-100 mg/m2), despite patients having normal baseline liver function and blood cell counts. Each patient recovered following the withdrawal of docetaxel. Severe toxicity related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. Mir O, Dessard-Diana B, Louet AL, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2010, 69(1): 99-101.A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours. One cohort of patients (n=4) received 10 mg of oral docetaxel and a subsequent cohort (n=8) 100 mg of oral docetaxel, coadministered with 100 mg oral ritonavir randomized to simultaneous administration or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel on days 1 and 8. On day 15 or 22, patients received 100 mg i.v. docetaxel. Docetaxel AUC in patients who received 10 mg oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was low, and the dose could safely be increased to 100 mg. The AUC in patients who received 100 mg oral docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was 2.4 ± 1.5 and 2.8 ± 1.4 mg/L.h, respectively, compared with 1.9 ± 0.4 mg/L.h after i.v. docetaxel. The apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was >100% (i.e. 131 ± 90% and 161 ± 91%, respectively), indicating marked inhibition by ritonavir of gut wall and/or hepatic metabolism. Coadministration of ritonavir significantly enhanced the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel and caution is essential when giving docetaxel with boosted PIs. Coadministration of ritonavir strongly enhances the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel in patients with solid tumors. Oostendorp RL, Huitema A, Rosing H, et al. Clin Cancer Res, 2009, 15(12): 4228-4233.A 30 year old Caucasian women receiving docetaxel-containing chemotherapy presented with symptoms suggestive of severe docetaxel toxicity (prolonged myelosuppression, grade 4 mucositis and desquamating rash) following commencement of lopinavir/ritonavir-containing post-exposure prophylaxis.

The use of higher ritonavir doses might alter the safety profile of the combination and therefore is not recommended. Telzir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, May 2011. The recommended dose of fosamprenavir/ritonavir in therapy-naive patients is 1400/200 mg once daily 1400/100 mg once daily or 700/100 mg twice daily. In protease inhibitor-experienced patients, the recommended dose of fosamprenavir/ritonavir is 700/100 mg twice daily; once-daily administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir is not recommended in protease inhibitor-experienced patients. Higher-than-approved dose combinations of fosamprenavir plus ritonavir are not recommended due to an increased risk of transaminase elevations. Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.Amprenavir has been approved for use with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the noted doses: amprenavir 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Coadministration of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased amprenavir AUC by 64% and Cmin by 5-fold, based on cross-study comparison to amprenavir alone (1200 mg twice daily). Ritonavir increases the serum levels of amprenavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Clinical trials confirmed the safety and efficacy of 600 mg amprenavir twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Ritonavir oral solution should not be co-administered with amprenavir oral solution to children due to the risk of toxicity from excipients in the two formulations. Coadministration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased amprenavir AUC by 2.4-fold and Cmin by 11-fold. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of amprenavir (from fosamprenavir) as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Fosamprenavir must be given with ritonavir to ensure its therapeutic effect. Clinical trials confirmed the safety and efficacy of fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Co-administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg twice daily has not been clinically evaluated.

Muret P, et al. 8th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Budapest, April 2007, abstract 26.The effect of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily, n=11) or fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily, n=15) was investigated in HIV-negative subjects. Ritonavir increased plasma amprenavir exposure to a similar extent when coadministered with either amprenavir or fosamprenavir. Geometric least square mean ratios for AUC, Cmax and Cmin (alone vs with ritonavir) for amprenavir were 3.16, 1.27 and 10.73 respectively, and for fosamprenavir were 3.40, 1.51 and 12.68 respectively, When given with ritonavir, amprenavir mean AUC increased from 8.21 to 26.2 µg.h/ml, Cmax from 3.66 to 4.69 µg/ml and Cmin from 0.12 to 1.32 µg/ml. Increases observed when fosamprenavir was coadministered with ritonavir were AUC increasing from 9.51 to 33.2 µg.h/ml, Cmax increasing from 3.19 to 4.92 µg/ml and Cmin increasing from 0.14 to 1.77 µg/ml. Ritonavir increases plasma amprenavir (APV) exposure to a similar extent when coadministered with either fosamprenavir or APV. Wire MB, Baker KL, Jones LS, et al.

Ruane P, Wire M, Shelton M, et al. 44th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Washington, October/November 2004, abstract A-449.The pharmacokinetics of amprenavir following standard doses of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) or high doses of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/100 mg or 1400/200 mg) were investigated in healthy subjects (13 per group). When compared to the standard dose, fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/100 mg produced increases in amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC of 26%, 81% and 54% respectively; ritonavir Cmin decreased by 11% and Cmax and AUC increased by 71% and 49% respectively. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/200 mg) resulted in increases in amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC of 32%, 48% and 26%. The regimen where only fosamprenavir was increased (i.e. 1400/100 mg) achieved the highest plasma amprenavir exposure.

ACTG5043 had a relatively complex design and examined PK interactions between amprenavir and efavirenz, both by themselves and when nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir was added. A PK study was conducted after the administration of single doses of amprenavir (600 mg, day 0). Subjects (n=56) received efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 10 days and restarted amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with efavirenz for days 11 to 13 with a PK study on day 14. A second PI (nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily; indinavir 1200 mg twice daily; ritonavir 100 mg twice daily; or saquinavir 1600 mg twice daily) was added to amprenavir and efavirenz on day 15, and a PK study was conducted on day 21. Controls continued amprenavir and efavirenz without a second PI. Amprenavir AUC was 46-61% lower with efavirenz (day 14 vs day 0; P values of <0.05). In the nelfinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir groups, day 21 amprenavir AUCs with efavirenz were higher than AUCs for efavirenz alone. The authors conclude that efavirenz lowered amprenavir AUC, but NFV, IDV or RTV compensated for efavirenz induction.

346,Ritonavir (RTV),Ifosfamide,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of ritonavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as ritonavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.","The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites.

349,Ritonavir (RTV),Imatinib,Potential Interaction,Moderate,"Imatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 1A2, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. In vitro data indicate that imatinib inhibits CYPs 3A4, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. The effect of low dose ritonavir on imatinib exposure is difficult to predict as clinical studies with CYP3A4 inhibitors have yielded differing results. Ketoconazole increased imatinib exposure; however, ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) had no significant effect on imatinib exposure. Use with caution and monitor for imatinib related side effects. Imatinib may increase exposure of CYP3A4 substrates, such as ritonavir. ","Substances that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 activity (e.g. protease inhibitors such as indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, nelfinavir, boceprevir; ketoconazole, itraconazole; erythromycin, clarithromycin) could decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (the mean Cmax and AUC of imatinib rose by 26% and 40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when it was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be taken when administering imatinib with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolised drugs.Glivec Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, October 2012.There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (mean Cmax and AUC increased by 26% and 40% respectively) in healthy subjects when imatinib was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution is recommended when administering imatinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir). Substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Particular caution is recommended when administering imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window.Gleevec Prescribing Information, Novartis, January 2013.Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg). The dose of imatinib was decreased by 50% during coadministration with ritonavir (for safety reasons) and pharmacokinetic parameters were normalised to an imatinib dose of 400 mg. Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib. The authors suggest that at steady state imatinib is insensitive to acute CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and relies on alternate elimination pathways.Influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib. van Erp NP, Gelderblom H, Karlsson MO et al.

Coadministration of indacterol (300 µg single dose) with ritonavir (300 mg twice daily for 7.5 days) increased indacaterol AUC by ~1.7-fold but had no effect on Cmax. This increase does not raise any safety concerns given the safety experience of indacaterol at doses up to twice the maximum recommended therapeutic dose in clinical studies of up to one year and dose adjustment is not required.","Coadministration of a single inhaled 300 µg dose of indacterol was studied alone and in combination with ritonavir in an open-label, two period, crossover study. Concomitant treatment resulted in a 1.7- to 1.8-fold increase in AUC, whereas Cmax was unaffected. As indacaterol has demonstrated good overall safety at daily doses of up to 600 μg over a year, the magnitude of exposure increases due to drug interactions do not raise any safety concerns for therapeutic doses up to 300 μg.No significant clinical drug-drug interaction potential with indacaterol.

Coadministration of indinavir/ritonavir (400/400 mg twice daily) had no effect on indinavir AUC but increased Cmin by 4-fold (relative to indinavir alone 800 mg three daily); ritonavir AUC and Cmin were unchanged. When indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) is coadministered caution is warranted as the risk of nephrolithiasis may be increased. The appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established. Preliminary clinical data suggest that indinavir 400 mg in combination with ritonavir 100 mg, both administered orally twice daily, may be an alternative dosing regimen.

Ritonavir decreases hepatic clearance of indinavir increasing the half life and results in an increase in indinavir trough concentrations with a small effect on Cmax. Where possible therapeutic drug monitoring should be used to ensure appropriate plasma concentrations of indinavir.Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased indinavir AUC by 178%, based on cross-study comparison to indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily); ritonavir AUC increased by 72%. Coadministration of indinavir (400 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) had no effect on indinavir AUC but increased Cmin by 4-fold (based on cross-study comparison to indinavir alone (800 mg three daily); ritonavir AUC and Cmin were unchanged. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of indinavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established. Minimal benefit of ritonavir-mediated pharmacokinetic enhancement is achieved with doses higher than 100 mg twice daily.

Enhanced levodopa effects including severe diskinesias were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

422,Ritonavir (RTV),Mebendazole,Potential Interaction,Moderate,"In a clinical study in 8 healthy volunteers, steady state ritonavir resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC (57%) and Cmax (59%). The clinical effect of mebendazole could potentially be reduced. The effect of a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor on mebendazole levels is unknown.","In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 1000mg mebendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. A trend towards an increase in mebendazole exposure after short-term intake of ritonavir was seen. However long-term administration resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC0-24 (57%) and Cmax (59%). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible.

Other medication included losartan-hydrochlorothiazide (100/25 mg per day), atenolol (100 mg/day), clopidogrel (75 mg/day), aspirin (325 mg/day), zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) and lamivudine (150 mg twice daily). He experienced dizziness, fatigue, and hypotension and developed complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm. Electrocardiogram abnormalities abated within 24 hours of discontinuing antiretroviral therapy. Medication was changed to nifedipine (60 mg/day), losartan (50 mg/day), aspirin (81 mg/day) and atenolol (50 mg/day), however, the patient developed orthostatic symptoms after restarting nelfinavir. He was switched successfully to an efavirenz-based regimen (efavirenz 600 mg once daily, stavudine 40 mg twice daily, didanosine 400 mg/day). Subsequent administration of antiretroviral therapy containing indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) with extended-release nifedipine resulted in recurrence of his orthostatic symptoms.

557,Ritonavir (RTV),Prasugrel,No Interaction Expected,Low,"Coadministration of prasugrel with a pharmacoenhancer has been evaluated in a clinical study. Prasugrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of prasugrel’s active metabolite by 52% and 43% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). However this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. Conversely, this same study showed that ritonavir or cobicistat significantly reduced both clopidogrel’s active metabolite exposure and inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. These data are in line with clinical observations as early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of ritonavir or cobicistat boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites.

Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04).

599,Ritonavir (RTV),Rifabutin,Potential Interaction,Moderate,"Initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed that concentrations of rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) were significantly increased when combined with a boosted protease inhibitor whereas rifabutin had no clinically significant effect on the exposure of most boosted protease inhibitors. Thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r and rifabutin (150 mg three times a week) resulted in rifabutin concentrations that were lower than those observed with rifabutin 300 mg once daily without protease inhibitors suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg 3 times a week and lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia). Coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg daily) and ritonavir (500 mg twice daily) increased rifabutin AUC (4-fold) and Cmin (2.5-fold). The AUC and Cmin of 25-o-desacetyl rifabutin metabolite increased by 38-fold and 16-fold, respectively. The European SPC contraindicates coadministration with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent.","LHPG Comment: Note the difference in SPC (European) and Prescribing Information (USA). In this case the charts reflect the use of low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer to boost plasma concentrations of other protease inhibitors. There is also a difference in pharmacokinetics when rifabutin is given daily compared to once or twice weekly.Due to the large increase in rifabutin AUC, the concomitant use of rifabutin with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is contraindicated due to an increase of rifabutin serum concentrations and risk of adverse events including uveitis. Based on parallel group comparison, coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg daily) and ritonavir (500 mg twice daily) increased rifabutin AUC by 4-fold and Cmin by 2.5-fold. AUC and Cmin of 25-o-desacetyl rifabutin metabolite were increased by 38-fold and 16-fold respectively. The reduction of the rifabutin dose to 150 mg 3 times per week may be indicated for select PIs when co-administered with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. The Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-administered protease inhibitor should be consulted for specific recommendations.

619,Ritonavir (RTV),Saquinavir (SQV),Potential Interaction,Low,"Ritonavir increases saquinavir plasma concentrations by inhibition of first pass metabolism, which raises Cmax, but has only a small effect on plasma half-life. Saquinavir has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir. The recommended dose is saquinavir/ritonavir 1000/100 mg twice daily. (Initiate treatment with saquinavir /ritonavir 500/100 mg twice daily for the first 7 days, then saquinavir/ritonavir 1000/100 mg twice daily in ART-naïve patients.) Doses of ritonavir higher than 100 mg twice daily should not be used. Higher doses of ritonavir have been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse events.","LHPG Comment: Pharmacoenhancement of saquinavir by ritonavir is currently being investigated to allow once or twice daily dosing of saquinavir. Several such regimens are in clinical practice. Ritonavir increases saquinavir plasma concentrations by inhibition of first pass metabolism, which raises Cmax, but has only a small effect on plasma half-life. Saquinavir has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir. Although interindividual variability in saquinavir concentrations is reduced, where possible therapeutic drug monitoring should be used to ensure adequate plasma concentrations of saquinavir. Details of the effect of ritonavir on saquinavir pharmacokinetics in some of the studies are available as a table in the attached document.Saquinavir has been approved for use with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the noted doses: saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Initiate treatment with saquinavir 500 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily for the first 7 days, then saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in ART-naïve patients. Doses of ritonavir higher than 100 mg twice daily should not be used. Higher doses of ritonavir have been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. Co-administration of saquinavir and ritonavir has led to severe adverse events, mainly diabetic ketoacidosis and liver disorders, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease. Based on cross-study comparison to saquinavir alone (600 mg three daily), coadministration of saquinavir (1000 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased saquinavir AUC by 15-fold and Cmin by 5-fold; ritonavir AUC and Cmin were unchanged. Based on cross-study comparison to saquinavir alone (600 mg three daily), coadministration of saquinavir (400 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) increased saquinavir AUC by 17-fold with no change in ritonavir AUC or Cmin. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of saquinavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Saquinavir should only be given in combination with ritonavir. Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily provides saquinavir systemic exposure over 24 hours similar to or greater than those achieved with saquinavir 1200 mg three times daily without ritonavir. Saquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin, due to the risk of severe hepatotoxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases) if the three medicines are given together. In a clinical study investigating the interaction of rifampicin 600 mg once daily and saquinavir 1000 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in healthy volunteers, severe hepatocellular toxicity with transaminase elevations up to >20-fold the upper limit of normal after 1 to 5 days of co-administration was noted. Due to the risk of severe hepatoxicity, saquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin. Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, September 2016.Coadministration is expected to increase saquinavir concentrations. See the complete Prescribing Information for saquinavir for details on co-administration of saquinavir and ritonavir.

For treatment-naive patients initiating treatment with Invirase/ritonavir, the starting recommended dose of Invirase is 500 mg (1 x 500 mg film-coated tablet) two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the first 7 days of treatment. After 7 days, the recommended dose of Invirase is 1000 mg two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Patients switching immediately from treatment with another protease inhibitor taken with ritonavir or from a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor based regimen, without a wash-out period, should however initiate and continue Invirase at the standard recommended dose of 1000 mg two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times daily. Invirase film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole and taken at the same time as ritonavir with or after food. In HIV-infected patients, Invirase or saquinavir soft capsules in combination with ritonavir at doses of 1000/100 mg twice daily provide a systemic exposure of saquinavir over a 24 hour period similar to or greater than that achieved with saquinavir soft capsules 1200 mg three times daily. Invirase Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, June 2012.Inivrase (1000 mg twice daily) must be used in combination with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) because it significantly inhibits saquinavir's metabolism to provide increased plasma saquinavir levels. When ritonavir (400 mg twice daily for 14 days) was coadministered with saquinavir (soft gel 400 mg twice daily for 14 days), in 8 healthy volunteers, saquinavir AUC and Cmax increased by 121% and 64%, respectively, compared to standard soft gel regimen (1200 mg three times daily, n=33).

Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin, reduced Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 53% and 76%, respectively. The exposure of the active metabolite and the plasma DPP4 activity inhibition over a dose interval were not influenced by rifampicin. The co‑administration of saxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin have not been studied and may result in decreased plasma concentration of saxagliptin and increased concentration of its major metabolite. Glycaemic control should be carefully assessed when saxagliptin is used concomitantly with a potent CYP3A4 inducer.Onglyza Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol Myers Squibb – Astra Zeneca, December 2011.Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) and saxagliptin (20 mg or 100 mg single dose) increased saxagliptin AUC by ~2.5-3.7 fold and increased Cmax by ~1.6-2.4 fold.

660,Ritonavir (RTV),Tamoxifen,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYPs 3A4 and 2D6 may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen.

Monitor clinical effect and increase tolbutamide dosage if needed.,(See Summary)
691,Ritonavir (RTV),Tolterodine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Tolterodine is primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 with CYP3A4 having a major role in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. The European SPC for tolterodine advises that coadministration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided due to increased tolterodine concentrations in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers whereas the US Prescribing Information recommends a maximum tolterodine dose of 1 mg twice daily.,(See Summary)
692,Ritonavir (RTV),Topiramate,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Topiramate is mainly eliminated by renal elimination in unchanged form (up to 60% of the dose) and partly by oxidation. Weak induction of CYP isozymes has been observed with higher doses of topiramate but this is not considered to be of clinical relevance with ritonavir.,(See Summary)
693,Ritonavir (RTV),Topotecan,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Topotecan undergoes both hepatic and renal elimination. Hepatic elimination involves mainly non-enzymatic hydrolysis and, to a minor extent, CYP mediated N-demethylation as well as glucuronidation. Renal elimination is by both active secretion (mainly via OAT3) and glomerular filtration. Topotecan is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors has been shown to increase topotecan exposure. Coadministration could potentially increase topotecan exposure due to inhibition of P-gp and BCRP and thus increase the risk and severity of topotecan-related side effects.",(See Summary)

ECG monitoring is recommended.,(See Summary)
696,Ritonavir (RTV),Tramadol,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Tramadol is metabolized by CYPs 3A4, 2B6, and 2D6. Metabolism by CYP2D6 is to a metabolite more potent than the parent compound. Ritonavir may increase tramadol exposure but also reduce the conversion to the more potent active metabolite. Monitoring for tramadol related side effects and for the analgesic effect may be required as clinically indicated. Adjust tramadol dosage if needed.","When ritonavir is coadministered with tramadol, plasma concentrations of tramadol may be increased and a decrease in dose may be needed.

701,Ritonavir (RTV),Treprostinil,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Treprostinil is mainly metabolized by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2C8 but induces CYP2C9. The inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 is predicted to be attenuated by the inducing effect on CYP2C9 and the overall effect on treprostinil exposure is likely to be of weak intensity. No a priori dosage adjustment is recommended.,(See Summary)
702,Ritonavir (RTV),Triamcinolone,Do Not Coadminister,Moderate,Coadministration is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects. Triamcinolone is metabolised by CYP3A4 and coadministration with boosted PIs could increase concentrations of triamcinolone. There are several case reports of Cushing's syndrome with the use of intra articular triamcinolone injections in patients on boosted PIs. A reduced dose of methylprednisolone has been suggested as a possible safer alternative to triamcinolone injection although there is insufficient information to indicate whether other injectable steroids present a lower risk than triamcinolone.,(See Summary)
703,Ritonavir (RTV),Triazolam,Do Not Coadminister,High,Coadministration is contraindicated as it is increases triazolam AUC by >20-fold and Cmin by 87%.

Coadministration of triazolam (0.125 mg single dose) and ritonavir (200 mg four doses) increased triazolam AUC by more than 20-fold and Cmin by 87%. Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, September 2016.Triazolam is contraindicated with ritonavir due to potential for serious and/or life threatening reactions such as prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression. Norvir Prescribing Information, AbbVie Inc, December 2016.The effect of ritonavir (200 mg 12 hourly, 4 doses) on triazolam (0.125 mg) was evaluated in six healthy volunteers. Ritonavir produced a large and highly significant increase in triazolam Cmax, an increase in AUC, prolongation of elimination half-life and decreased clearance to less than 4% when compared to control values. The increased plasma concentration of triazolam were accompanied by enhanced pharmacodynamic activity of triazolam. Therefore, initial exposure to ritonavir in triazolam-treated patients will in fact increase the potential for excessive sedative effects and cautions regarding possible hazards of this combination appear to be warranted.

704,Ritonavir (RTV),Triclabendazole,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"This interaction has not been studied. In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased ritonavir plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As ritonavir is an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes, there is potential to increase levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.",(See Summary)

732,Ritonavir (RTV),Warfarin,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration of warfarin (5 mg single dose) and ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) increased both the AUC and Cmin of S-warfarin by 9%; R-warfarin AUC decreased by 33%, but there was no change in Cmin. Decreased R-warfarin levels reduce anticoagulation. Initial frequent monitoring of the INR is indicated.","Coadministration of warfarin (5 mg single dose) and ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) increased both the AUC and Cmin of S-warfarin by 9%; R-warfarin AUC was decreased by 33%, but there was no change in Cmin. Induction of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 lead to decreased levels of R-warfarin while little pharmacokinetic effect is noted on S- warfarin when co-administered with ritonavir. Decreased R-warfarin levels may lead to reduced anticoagulation, therefore it is recommended that anticoagulation parameters are monitored when warfarin is co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, September 2016.The coadministration of ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours for 12 days) and a single 5 mg dose of warfarin was investigated in 12 subjects. S-warfarin AUC was increased by 9% and the Cmax decreased by 9%. The AUC for the R-enantiomer was decreased by 33% and the Cmax unaltered with coadministration of ritonavir. Initial frequent monitoring of the INR during ritonavir and warfarin coadministration is indicated. Norvir Prescribing Information, AbbVie Inc, December 2016.There is a case report where the warfarin dose had to be almost doubled to maintain INR whilst on ritonavir. When ritonavir was discontinued, the INR rose rapidly and the warfarin requirement decreased significantly. A potentiation of warfarin effect was expected when coadministered with ritonavir, however the opposite occurred. Frequent, careful monitoring of warfarin is recommended when coadministered with ritonavir. Potential for either an increase or decrease in INR.

746,Ritonavir (RTV),Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. Inhibition of CYP3A by ritonavir is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known.

752,Ritonavir (RTV),Retinol (Vitamin A) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. A clinical study demonstrated that ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir increased the activity of retinal dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.
