However, in specific clinical situations where an intensification of HIV treatment is needed, coadministration with cobicistat would be possible from a pharmacokinetic standpoint. Coadministration with ritonavir increased doravirine AUC by 3.5 fold and Cmin by 2.9 fold. No dose adjustment of doravirine is required as phase I trials showed a good tolerability of doravirine with up to a 3-4 fold increase in exposure. Boosted PIs were shown to increase tenofovir-DF. There are currently inadequate data to determine whether tenofovir-DF plus cobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions than tenofovir-DF without cobicistat. The European SmPC for tenofovir-DF advises close renal monitoring of patients receiving tenofovir-DF with a cobicistat-boosted protease inhibitor. The US Prescribing Information for cobicistat does not recommend coadministration of cobicistat and tenofovir-DF in combination with concomitant or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. Note, cobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine and should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 ml/min if tenofovir-DF requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance. A similar recommendation is to be observed for atazanavir/cobicistat.

307,Doravirine/Lamivudine/ Tenofovir-DF (DOR/3TC/TDF),Garlic,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Garlic supplements have been shown to decrease unboosted saquinavir AUC by 50% in a clinical trial and there is a case report of treatment failure due to garlic cloves (six garlic cloves three times weekly) decreasing ritonavir-boosted atazanavir trough concentrations by ~70%. This effect has been attributed to the induction of intestinal CYP3A4 and/or P-gp by garlic. Garlic could decrease the exposure of doravirine as it is metabolized by CYP3A4. Patients should be advised against the use of garlic supplements. At least a 4-week cessation period is recommended prior to initiation of doravirine due to the persisting inducing effect upon discontinuation of a moderate/strong inducer. No interaction is expected with lamivudine.

Doravirine AUC and C24 were unchanged when administered with a single dose of rifampicin; doravirine Cmax increased by 40%. From this, the authors conclude that interaction through P-gp inhibition by rifampicin is unlikely to be an issue. Conversely, when a single dose of doravirine was administered alongside once daily rifampicin, doravirine AUC, Cmax and C24 reduced by 88%, 57% and 97%, respectively. This reduction in doravirine exposure is likely to be due to CYP3A induction by rifampicin.

The renal transporter involved in moxonidine excretion is unknown but does not seem to involve P-glycoprotein or renal organic cation (OCT) transporters. No interaction is expected with doravirine or lamivudine (eliminated by OCT2), however, an interaction with tenofovir-DF cannot be excluded. ",(See Summary)
756,Doravirine/Lamivudine/ Tenofovir-DF (DOR/3TC/TDF),Thiamine (Vitamin B1) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. ,(See Summary)
757,Doravirine/Lamivudine/ Tenofovir-DF (DOR/3TC/TDF),Sevelamer,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Sevelamer is a resin not absorbed from the GI tract that may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. In the absence of data, when administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer. [Note: this interaction is not specific for doravirine, lamivudine and tenofovir-DF, but for any medication taken with sevelamer.]",(See Summary)
758,Doravirine/Lamivudine/ Tenofovir-DF (DOR/3TC/TDF),Eletriptan,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Eletriptan is metabolised by CYP3A4 and does not induce or inhibit CYPs. ,(See Summary)
759,Doravirine/Lamivudine/ Tenofovir-DF (DOR/3TC/TDF),Phytomenadione (Vitamin K) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Metabolism of phytomenadione is thought to involve CYP4F2 and glucuronidation. Renal elimination of phytomenadione is minimal.,(See Summary)
760,Doravirine/Lamivudine/ Tenofovir-DF (DOR/3TC/TDF),Ferrous fumarate,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.,(See Summary)
761,Doravirine/Lamivudine/ Tenofovir-DF (DOR/3TC/TDF),Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Pyridoxine is absorbed from the GI tract and is converted to the active form pyridoxal phosphate. It is excreted in the urine as 4-pyridoxic acid.,(See Summary)
