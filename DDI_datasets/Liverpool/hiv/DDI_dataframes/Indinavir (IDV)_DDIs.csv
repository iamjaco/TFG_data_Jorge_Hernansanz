0,Indinavir (IDV),Abacavir (ABC),No Interaction Expected,Moderate,No data with indinavir/ritonavir. Coadministration with indinavir alone to HIV+ subjects showed that abacavir had no significant effect on indinavir concentrations.,"Abacavir has also been shown in vitro not to inhibit CYP 3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Induction of hepatic metabolism has not been observed in clinical studies. Therefore, there is little potential for interactions with antiretroviral PIs.Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, December 2018.The effect of abacavir (300 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir was assessed in HIV+ subjects receiving indinavir 1000 mg three times daily with efavirenz 600 mg once daily, or indinavir/efavirenz 1200/300 mg twice daily.

1,Indinavir (IDV),Acamprosate,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acamprosate is eliminated unchanged in the urine.,(See Summary)
2,Indinavir (IDV),Acarbose,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. After ingestion of acarbose, the majority of active unchanged drug remains in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to exert its pharmacological activity and is metabolised by intestinal enzymes and by the microbial flora.",(See Summary)
3,Indinavir (IDV),Acenocoumarol,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ritonavir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9. Indinavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease acenocoumarol concentrations. Monitor INR.,(See Summary)
4,Indinavir (IDV),Acetazolamide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acetazolamide is primarily excreted unchanged via the kidneys, there is therefore little potential for interaction with indinavir via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.",(See Summary)
5,Indinavir (IDV),Aciclovir (Acyclovir),Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as aciclovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1. However both drugs can induce crystalluria and therefore should be administered with caution.,(See Summary)
6,Indinavir (IDV),Acitretin,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as acitretin undergoes isomerisation and glucuronidation.",(See Summary)
7,Indinavir (IDV),Aclidinium bromide,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aclidinium bromide is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed (non-enzymatic and enzymatic transformation by esterases and butylrylcholineesterases) to its pharmacologically inactive metabolites with only a minor role for CYP metabolism.,(See Summary)
8,Indinavir (IDV),Adalimumab,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Adalimumab is a monoclonal IgG antibody. Elimination is similar to endogenous IgG and occurs primarily via proteolytic catabolism throughout the body.,(See Summary)

10,Indinavir (IDV),Adrenaline (Epinephrine),No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated, mostly in the liver by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). There is therefore little potential for interaction with indinavir via modulation of, or competition for metabolic or elimination pathways.",(See Summary)
11,Indinavir (IDV),African Potato,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolic data there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. African potato was shown to inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp in vitro and to activate PXR suggesting that inhibition may occur initially followed by induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp when used for extended periods. However, coadministration of African potato with lopinavir/ritonavir in healthy volunteers did not result in significant pharmacokinetic changes suggesting that boosting by ritonavir could offset the inducing effect of African potato. Similarly, no significant effect is expected on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir.",(See Summary)
12,Indinavir (IDV),Agomelatine,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Agomelatine is metabolised predominantly by CYP1A2 which is induced by ritonavir. Coadministration with indinavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease agomelatine exposure. Monitor clinical effect and increase dosage if needed. ,(See Summary)
13,Indinavir (IDV),Albendazole,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 and the flavine-containing monooxygenase system are involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. Short term (2 doses) coadministration with ritonavir (200 mg) did not impact albendazole pharmacokinetics whereas long-term coadministration (8 days) decreased albendazole exposure likely due to ritonavir inducing effect. Indinavir/ritonavir is unlikely to significantly affect albendazole exposure when used for a short duration treatment but may reduce the clinical effect of albendazole when used for a long duration treatment.,"In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400 mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and  its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

14,Indinavir (IDV),Albuvirtide,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Albuvirtide is a peptide which is eliminated by catabolism to its constituent amino acids. Based on data from studies with lopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations of indinavir and ritonavir may decrease but this is not expected to be clinically relevant. Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. However, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone (lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 37%, 33% and 35%, respectively; ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 38%, 39% and 28%, respectively). The mean lopinavir Ctrough in presence of albuvirtide (7.1 µg/ml) remained higher than the minimal lopinavir Ctrough previously associated with efficacy. Furthermore, a randomized, phase 3 study (TALENT study) showed that albuvirtide + lopinavir/ritonavir was non-inferior to the standard second-line regimen lopinavir/ritonavir + zidovudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine in HIV infected Chinese individuals suggesting that this interaction has no clinical consequences. In vitro human microsomal studies indicate that albuvirtide has no inducing properties on P450 enzymes. In addition, albuvirtide binds to <1% of serum albumin in the range of clinical concentrations, thus the observed decrease in lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations is unlikely to result from protein binding displacement. However, binding of the albuvirtide-albumin complex to the HIV protease inhibitor cannot be excluded.","Coadministration of albuvirtide (320 mg once weekly intravenous) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 9 HIV-infected individuals. Albuvirtide exposure was not significantly affected by lopinavir/ritonavir. Conversely, both lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were lower in presence of albuvirtide compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone. The mean ratios (90% CI) of AUC, Cmax and Ctrough for lopinavir were 0.63 (0.49-0.82), 0.67 (053-0.86) and 0.65 (0.46-0.91). For ritonavir, AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 0.62 (0.42-0.91), 0.61 (0.38-0.99) and 0.72 (0.40-1.26).

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma viral load <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Non-inferiority was pre-specified with a margin of 12%. Interim analysis of 48 week data from 46 subjects in the albuvirtide group and 50 patients in the control group showed 80.4% patients in the albuvirtide group had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL versus 66.0% in the control group (difference 14.4%, 95% CI -3.0% -31.9%), meeting the non-inferiority criteria.Efficacy and safety of long-acting HIV fusion inhibitor albuvirtide in antiretroviral-experienced adults with HIV-1: interim 48-week results from the randomized, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority TALENT study.

If coadministration is deemed necessary, increasing canagliflozin to 300 mg once daily may be considered if patients are currently tolerating canagliflozin 100 mg once daily, have an eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 or CrCl ≥60 mL/min, and require additional glycaemic control. Other glucose-lowering therapies should be considered for patients with an eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73m2 to <60 mL/min/1.73m2 or CrCl 45 mL/min to <60 mL/min taking canagliflozin 100 mg who are receiving concurrent therapy with a UGT enzyme inducer and who require additional glycaemic control.",(See Summary)

106,Indinavir (IDV),Carbidopa,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Enhanced levodopa effects including severe diskinesias were described in a case report after initiation of an antiretroviral regimen containing indinavir to an individual who was previously stable on levodopa/carbidopa therapy. When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa/carbidopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

128,Indinavir (IDV),Ciclesonide,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Ciclesonide can be administered with indinavir without dose adjustment, but with close monitoring. There is a risk of steroid side effects occurring, particularly if a high dose is used, or in case of prolonged administration, or if used with another medicine containing corticosteroids. These side effects are also more likely during periods of physiological stress. Ciclesonide is a pro-drug activated by esterases in the lungs to des-ciclesonide which then undergoes CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 7 days) with orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 µg once daily) did not alter ciclesonide but resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the AUC and a 2-fold increase in the Cmax of des-ciclesonide. Ciclesonide is mainly absorbed by the lungs, has a high protein binding and a high clearance resulting in a lower potential to cause systemic effects compared to some other inhaled corticosteroids. Hence, any interaction with indinavir would not require any dosage/therapy adjustments, particularly if ciclesonide is administered at lower or medium clinical doses, but close monitoring for Cushing’s syndrome signs is required when using a higher dose or with prolonged administration. ",(See Summary)

149,Indinavir (IDV),Clopidogrel,Do Not Coadminister,Low,"Coadministration of clopidogrel and boosted regimens has been evaluated in clinical studies. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite both by 69% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). In HIV-negative subjects (n=12), coadministration of clopidogrel and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 51% and 48%. Importantly, the decrease in clopidogrel’s active metabolite lead to insufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation in 44% of the patients treated with clopidogrel and ritonavir or cobicistat. Consistently, the study in HIV-negative subjects showed that the average inhibition of platelet aggregation was decreased from 51% (clopidogrel alone) to 31% (clopidogrel + ritonavir). Of interest, the study with HIV-infected patients showed a comparable decrease in prasugrel’s active metabolite AUC (52% decrease), however this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. The differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect is in line with clinical observations. Early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Taken together these data suggest that given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","A 64-year-old man presented with increasing shortness of breath, fatigue  and chest pain radiating to his left shoulder and neck.

Simultaneous administration did not significantly change dabigatran PK (possibly due to mixed induction and inhibition of P-gp by ritonavir as dabigatran is a substrate of P-gp). Administration 2 hours before ritonavir decreased dabigatran AUC by 29% and Cmax by 27% (n=16). These results suggests that dabigatran can be administered simultaneously with ritonavir when used once daily as a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with no renal impairment, though no data are available when ritonavir is used twice daily as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Data with verapamil (a P-gp inhibitor) and dabigatran suggest caution is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment as the dabigatran dose might need to be reduced in presence of a P-gp inhibitor such as indinavir/ritonavir. Note, dabigatran is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment.","Coadministration of dabigatran (150 mg single dose) with ritonavir (100 mg, once daily, n=16) was studied in healthy volunteers in a cross-over study. Dabigatran was given either 2 hours before or simultaneously with ritonavir.

In individuals with normal renal function, predicted Ctrough were within dabigatran therapeutic range (28-210 ng/ml) when dabigatran was administered concurrently with or 2 hours before verapamil at a dose of 150 mg twice daily. However, Ctrough was below the lower limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered at 110 mg twice daily 2 hours before verapamil but still within the therapeutic range in case of simultaneous administration. In individuals with mild renal impairment, predicted Ctrough exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered concurrently or 2 hours before verapamil at a dose of 150 mg twice daily but were within the therapeutic range when administered at a dose of 110 mg twice daily. In individuals with moderate renal impairment, predicted Ctrough exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered concurrently with and 2 hours before verapamil at a dose of 110 mg twice daily but were within the therapeutic range when administered at a dose of 75 mg twice daily. Finally, in individuals with severe renal impairment, predicted Ctrough exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic range when dabigatran was administered concurrently with verapamil at a dose of 75 mg twice daily. This study indicates that dabigatran dosage in presence of a P-gp inhibitor such as verapamil varies depending on the renal function.

Ideally avoid coadministration with boosted protease inhibitors or consider using an alternative taxane. ","Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. Taxotere (docetaxel) Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-Aventis, December 2009.Three cases have been reported where administration of IV docetaxel to HIV+ patients on ritonavir-containing regimens resulted in severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity 3-7 days after the first infusion of docetaxel (70-100 mg/m2), despite patients having normal baseline liver function and blood cell counts. Each patient recovered following the withdrawal of docetaxel. Severe toxicity related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. Mir O, Dessard-Diana B, Louet AL, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2010, 69(1): 99-101.A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours.

Based on these data, Echinacea is unlikely to alter indinavir/ritonavir exposure but caution is advised with indinavir alone.","The effect of echinacea on CYP activity was assessed by use of a number of CYP probe drugs (caffeine for CYP1A2; tolbutamide for CYP2C9; dextromethorphan for CYP2D6 and midazolam for both hepatic and intestinal CYP3A) in a study in 12 healthy volunteers. The data demonstrated that echinacea caused inhibition of CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity and induction of hepatic CYP3A activity. The authors indicate that for CYP3A substrates (such as protease inhibitors), the type of drug interaction observed with echinacea will be dependent on the relative extraction of the drugs at hepatic and intestinal sites and will not be readily predicted. Certainly echinacea could contribute to inter-patient variability in protease inhibitor levels. The effect of echinacea (Echinacea purpurea) root on cytochrome P450 activity in vivo.

225,Indinavir (IDV),Efavirenz (EFV),Potential Interaction,Moderate,"Coadministration of efavirenz with indinavir alone decreases indinavir concentrations; increasing indinavir to 1000 mg three times daily did not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz. Coadministration with indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 twice daily) had no effect on efavirenz AUC or Cmin, but decreased the AUC and Cmin of indinavir and ritonavir. No specific dose recommendation can be given for indinavir alone. Dose increases of indinavir/ritonavir when given in combination with efavirenz have not been studied. ","An increased dose (1000mg three times daily) of indinavir does not compensate for the inducing effect of efavirenz. When compared to indinavir (800 mg three times daily), coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and indinavir (1000 mg three time daily) decreased indinavir AUC by 46% and Cmin by 57%. Coadministration of a lower dose of efavirenz (200 mg once daily) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily) decreased indinavir AUC by 31% and Cmin by 40%; efavirenz AUC was unchanged. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 twice daily) had no effect on efavirenz AUC or Cmin. Indinavir AUC and Cmin decreased by 25% and 50%; ritonavir AUC and Cmin decreased by 36% and 39%. No specific dose recommendation can be given for indinavir alone. Dose increases of indinavir/ritonavir when given in combination with efavirenz have not been studied. Crixivan Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, February 2012.Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 10 days) and indinavir (1000 mg three time daily for 10 days) to 20 HIV+ subjects resulted in no change in indinavir Cmax for the morning and afternoon doses and a 29% decrease for the evening dose. Indinavir AUC decreased by 33-37% for the morning and afternoon doses, and by 46% for the evening dose. Indinavir Cmin decrease by 39%, 52% and 57% for the morning, afternoon and evening doses respectively. There were no significant changes in efavirenz Cmax or AUC. The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with efavirenz, is not known. Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz. Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, April 2012.When indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) was given with efavirenz (200 mg every 24 hours), indinavir AUC and Cmin were decreased by 31% and 40% respectively. A similar reduction in indinavir exposures was observed when indinavir 1000 mg every 8 hours was given with efavirenz 600 mg daily. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed for efavirenz. While the clinical significance of decreased indinavir concentrations has not been established, the magnitude of the observed pharmacokinetic interaction should be taken into consideration when choosing a regimen containing both efavirenz and indinavir. No adjustment of the dose of efavirenz is necessary when given with indinavir. When efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was given with indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily), indinavir AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were decreased by approximately 25%, 50% and 17%, respectively, compared to indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg twice daily given without efavirenz. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed for efavirenz. The geometric mean Cmin for indinavir (0.33 mg/L) when given with ritonavir and efavirenz was higher than the mean historical Cmin (0.15 mg/L) when indinavir was given alone at 800 mg every 8 hours. In HIV-1 infected patients (n=6), the pharmacokinetics of indinavir and efavirenz were generally comparable to these uninfected volunteer data. No adjustment of the dose of efavirenz is necessary when given with indinavir/ritonavir. Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.Coadministration of indinavir (1000 mg every 8 hours) and efavirenz (600 mg), was studied in 20 subjects. When compared to values obtained with indinavir alone (800 mg every 8 hours), no alteration in indinavir Cmax was observed after the morning or afternoon dose, whereas a 29% reduction was observed following the evening dose. Indinavir AUC was reduced by 33%, 37% and 46% and Cmin was reduced by 39%, 52% and 57% following morning, afternoon and evening doses, respectively. No alterations in efavirenz Cmax, AUC or Cmin were observed when efavirenz (200 mg once daily for 14 days) was given with indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours for 14 days) to 11 subjects. The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with efavirenz is not known. Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz. When indinavir at an increased dose (1000 mg every 8 hours) was given with efavirenz (600 mg once daily), the indinavir AUC and Cmin were decreased on average by 33-46% and 39-57%, respectively, compared to when indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) was given alone.Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.Adequate indinavir concentrations were described in 29-year old HIV+ Thai male receiving indinavir/ritonavir with efavirenz and rifampicin. Prior to the introduction of rifampicin-based TB therapy, the patient had been receiving indinavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). Indinavir trough and peakl plasma concentrations were 1.73 mg/L and 11.21 mg/L, respectively; efavirenz concentration determined mid-dose was 1.06 mg/L. Following the introduction of rifampicin, indinavir/ritonavir was maintained at 600/100 mg, giving indinavir trough and peak concentrations of 0.26 and 4.66 mg/L, respectively. Efavirenz was increased to 800 mg once daily, giving a mid-dose efavirenz concentration of 4.69 mg/L. After completion of TB therapy, the efavirenz dose was reduced to 600 mg. Although indinavir concentrations were significantly reduced, they were still compatible with clinical efficacy, as well as improved tolerability and safety. The reduction in indinavir concentrations was associated with improved renal function and the increased efavirenz dose was well tolerated. Indinavir has generally not been combined with rifampicin because of significant reductions in indinavir concentrations. However, it may be possible, especially with low body weight, to use indinavir at the usual dose (800/100 mg twice daily) in the presence of rifampicin and achieve a satisfactory therapeutic effect despite enzymic induction.Maintenance of successful ritonavir-boosted indinavir and efavirenz therapy in an HIV-infected patient with tuberculosis.

AIDS, 2006, 20(7): 1083-1085.The effect of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir/ritonavir (400/400 mg twice daily) was studied in 8 HIV+ subjects. Neither indinavir nor RTV parameters were significantly changed in the presence of efavirenz. Indinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin were 2.9 vs 2.6 mg/L, 17.6 vs 16.2 mg/L.h, and 0.5 vs 0.4 mg/L, alone vs combination respectively. Ritonavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin were 6.6 vs 5.0 mg/L, 42.8 vs 37.7 mg/L.h, and 1.7 vs 1.7 mg/L, alone vs combination respectively. Pharmacokinetic profiles of indinavir, ritonavir and efavirenz were comparable to historical data. Pharmacokinetics of indinavir and ritonavir +/- efavirenz in HIV-infected patients. King, J et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 33.A pharmacokinetic study was performed in 6 HIV patients receiving indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). The geometric mean indinavir Cmin was 0.32 mg/L (95% CI 0.13-0.82) and was lower than had been previously reported for indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) without efavirenz. Cmin values were above the target of 0.15 mg/L in 5/6 patients. The geometric mean Cmin for efavirenz at 24 h was 2.7 mg/L (95% CI 1.3-5.7) and was higher than described in product literature (1.8 mg/L). Efavirenz Cmin was above the minimum target value of 1.0 mg/L in all 6 subjects; 2 subjects had concentrations above the upper target of 4.0 mg/L.

Coadministration of indinavir (400, 600 or 800 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was studied in 6 HIV+ subjects, 5 of whom were also taking efavirenz. Evening indinavir trough concentrations were 141 ng/ml (400 mg), 248 ng/ml (600 mg) and 474 ng/ml (800 mg); evening trough concentrations were 56% lower than morning trough concentrations. Evening troughs were above an efficacy threshold of 150 ng/ml in all subjects on 800 mg, but were below target in one subject on 600 mg and four subjects on 400 mg.

The steady state pharmacokinetics of indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) were evaluated in 20 HIV+ Thai subjects. Indinavir geometric mean (with 95% CI) AUC, Cmin and Cmax were 45.7 (39.8-52.5) mg/L.h, 0.32 ( 0.24-0.44) mg/L and 11.1 (9.4-13.0) mg/L respectively. A >10-fold variation in Cmin was observed, but all were at least comparable to those obtained following indinavir 800 mg three times daily alone. Efavirenz geometric mean Cmin at 24 h was 2.1 mg/L (95% CI 1.6-2.6 mg/L) and was 30-35% higher than previously reported in healthy volunteers.

Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg bd) to 14 healthy volunteers resulted in significant decreases in indinavir AUC (-25%), Cmin (-50%) and Cmax (-17%). Cmin values were similar to those obtained with 800 mg indinavir given three times daily without ritonavir. Efavirenz concentrations were comparable to historical data. The dose of indinavir or ritonavir should be increased to maintain similar concentrations after the addition of efavirenz to a indinavir/ritonavir regimen.

333,Indinavir (IDV),Heroin,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Indinavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1).

There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of indinavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as indinavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.","The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites.

Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction.

However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib. The authors suggest that at steady state imatinib is insensitive to acute CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and relies on alternate elimination pathways.Influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib. van Erp NP, Gelderblom H, Karlsson MO et al.

When reintroduced alone, indinavir monotherapy induced the abnormal movements, which resolved on discontinuation. Clinical monitoring for levodopa efficacy is warranted if co-administered with protease inhibitors.","A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity.

Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, April 2012.A 51-year-old man with HIV infection who was receiving extended-release nifedipine (60 mg/day) developed symptomatic orthostasis and heart block after starting antiretroviral therapy that included nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily). Other medication included losartan-hydrochlorothiazide (100/25 mg per day), atenolol (100 mg/day), clopidogrel (75 mg/day), aspirin (325 mg/day), zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) and lamivudine (150 mg twice daily). He experienced dizziness, fatigue, and hypotension and developed complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm. Electrocardiogram abnormalities abated within 24 hours of discontinuing antiretroviral therapy. Medication was changed to nifedipine (60 mg/day), losartan (50 mg/day), aspirin (81 mg/day) and atenolol (50 mg/day), however, the patient developed orthostatic symptoms after restarting nelfinavir. He was switched successfully to an efavirenz-based regimen (efavirenz 600 mg once daily, stavudine 40 mg twice daily, didanosine 400 mg/day). Subsequent administration of antiretroviral therapy containing indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) with extended-release nifedipine resulted in recurrence of his orthostatic symptoms. Drug therapy at that time consisted of nifedipine (60 mg/day), atenolol (100 mg/day), losartan (50 mg twice daily) and zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) and abacavir (300 mg twice daily). Discontinuation of atenolol, and nifedipine dosage reduction to 30 mg/day were effective in managing his orthostatic changes.Symptomatic Orthostasis With Extended-Release Nifedipine and Protease Inhibitors.

556,Indinavir (IDV),Prasugrel,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration of prasugrel with a pharmacoenhancer has been evaluated in a clinical study. Prasugrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. In HIV-positive subjects, the presence of a pharmacoenhancer (ritonavir n=8; cobicistat n=1) decreased the AUC and Cmax of prasugrel’s active metabolite by 52% and 43% when compared to values obtained in HIV-negative subjects (n=12). However this decrease did not impair prasugrel’s antiplatelet effect. Conversely, this same study showed that ritonavir or cobicistat significantly reduced both clopidogrel’s active metabolite exposure and inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. These data are in line with clinical observations as early thrombosis of a coronary stent was reported in a patient treated with darunavir/ritonavir concomitantly with clopidogrel while subsequent replacement of clopidogrel by prasugrel did not lead to novel stent thrombosis episodes. Given the risk of diminished clopidogrel response, prasugrel should be preferred in presence of ritonavir or cobicistat boosted regimens, unless the patient has a clinical condition which contraindicates its use in which case an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.","The impact of boosted antiretroviral therapies on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites (AM) and on the efficacy of prasugrel and clopidogrel were evaluated in a randomized crossover study. A significantly lower exposure of clopidogrel AM (69% decrease) and prasugrel AM (52% decrease) were demonstrated in HIV-infected patients treated sequentially with a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg) while on a ritonavir- or cobicistat- containing antiretroviral regimen compared to healthy volunteers receiving only the corresponding antiplatelet agent. Of interest, the coadministration with ritonavir or cobicistat had a differential impact on clopidogrel and prasugrel pharmacodynamics effect. Treatment with clopidogrel resulted in adequate platelet inhibition in all healthy volunteers (no coadministration of ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens) while 44% of HIV-infected patients were shown to have insufficient platelet inhibition (coadministration with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted regimens). On the contrary, treatment with prasugrel resulted in a potent platelet inhibition in both healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The authors conclude that prasugrel remains an adequate antiplatelet agent in HIV-infected patients and could be preferred to clopidogrel in this context, regardless of the metabolic interaction and inhibition of its bioactivation pathways.Impact of boosted antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites.

Red yeast rice contains monacolin K (a natural component with the same chemical structure as lovastatin) which is metabolised by CYP3A4. Indinavir could significantly increase the exposure of monacolin K due to inhibition of CYP3A4. There are two case reports of rhabdomyolysis resulting from drug-drug interactions with red yeast rice (one with ciclosporin; one with sertraline and rosuvastatin). Since coadministration with lovastatin is contraindicated due to the potential for serious reactions such as myopathy including rhabdomyolysis, red yeast rice should not be coadministered with indinavir. ",(See Summary)

595,Indinavir (IDV),Retinol (Vitamin A) [in multivitamins],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely with retinol when given alone or in multivitamins. Clinical and in vitro studies have suggested that indinavir increased the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid on lipid accumulation during fat cell differentiation. Retinal dehydrogenase gene expression was induced by indinavir, which could potentially increase retinoic acid concentrations and promote some of the adverse reactions associated with indinavir therapy, such as altered lipid metabolism. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV. HIV-protease inhibitors alter retinoic acid synthesis. AIDS. 2001 Oct 19;15(15):1979-84.Indinavir and retinoids have been associated with nail, skin, and hair defects, suggesting that indinavir and retinoids may exert their effects through similar molecular mechanisms. This hypothesis was tested by examining the effects of PIs on retinoid signaling in vitro. Mesenchymal stem cells (C3H10T1/2) were cultured in the presence of PIs (amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir) and synthetic retinoids, and the metabolic response was assessed by measuring the activity of a retinoid-regulated protein, alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Of the PIs tested, only indinavir stimulated ATRA-dependent ALP activity and altered stem cell morphology; the effects of indinavir occurred in the presence of ATRA, but not in its absence. Indinavir increased the effects of ATRA on lipid accumulation during fat cell differentiation. AGN 193109 a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonist, inhibited the synergistic effects of indinavir and ATRA, indicating that indinavir increases RAR signaling. However, indinavir did not potentiate ALP activity in the presence of the RAR agonist CH55. These observations support the proposal that altered retinoid signaling promotes some of the adverse reactions associated with indinavir therapy, such as altered lipid metabolism.Lenhard JM, Weiel JE, Paulik MA, Furfine ES.

598,Indinavir (IDV),Rifabutin,Potential Interaction,High,"Initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed that concentrations of rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) were significantly increased when combined with a boosted protease inhibitor whereas rifabutin had no clinically significant effect on the exposure of most boosted protease inhibitors. Thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r and rifabutin (150 mg three times a week) resulted in rifabutin concentrations that were lower than those observed with rifabutin 300 mg once daily without protease inhibitors suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg  3 times a week and lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia). Coadministration of rifabutin with indinavir alone decreased indinavir exposure and increased rifabutin exposure. A dosage reduction of rifabutin to half the standard dose and a dosage increase of indinavir to 1000-1200 mg every 8 hours is suggested when rifabutin is co-administered with indinavir alone. ","LHPG Comment: The studies below refer to non–boosted indinavir regimens. In most clinical practice, indinavir will be given in combination with ritonavir. The presence of ritonavir is likely to affect the magnitude of the interaction.Dose reduction of rifabutin and dose increase of indinavir has not been confirmed in clinical studies. No dose recommendations for indinavir/ritonavir with rifabutin could be given. Therefore co-administration is not recommended. If rifabutin treatment is required, alternative agents for treating HIV infection should be sought. Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg three times daily) and rifabutin (300 mg once daily) decrease indinavir AUC by 34% and Cmin by 39%; rifabutin AUC increased by 173% and Cmin increased by 244%. Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg three times daily) and rifabutin (150 mg once daily) decreased indinavir AUC by 32% and decreased Cmin by 40%. When compared to rifabutin 300 mg once daily alone, rifabutin AUC increased by 54% and Cmin increased by 99%. No data has been obtained comparing rifabutin 150 mg once daily in combination with indinavir 800 mg three times daily with a reference dose of 150 mg rifabutin alone. The interaction with indinavir/ritonavir has not been studied. Decreased indinavir concentrations and increased rifabutin concentrations are expected. Crixivan Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, February 2012.Coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg once daily for 10 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily for 10 days) to 14 subjects resulted in decreases in indinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 20%, 32% and 40% respectively. Rifabutin Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 29%, 54% and 99% respectively when compared to values obtained following administration of 300 mg once daily alone for 11 days. Coadministration of rifabutin (300mg once daily for 10 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily for 10 days) to 10 subjects resulted in decreases in indinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 25%, 34% and 29% respectively. Rifabutin Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 2.3-, 2.7- and 3.4-fold respectively. Dose reduction of rifabutin to half the standard dose and a dose increase of indinavir to 1000 mg every 8 hours are recommended when rifabutin and indinavir are coadministered. Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, April 2012.Coadministration of indinavir (1000 mg three times daily) and rifabutin (150 mg daily) to 18 healthy volunteers and 10 HIV+ subjects resulted in an indinavir AUC similar to that obtained following 800 mg three times daily alone. Rifabutin and 25-desacety lrifabutin AUCs when coadministered with indinavir were 70% and 120% higher than with rifabutin 300 mg alone. Increasing indinavir to 1000 mg three times daily compensates for rifabutin induction of indinavir metabolism. The clinical significance of the increase in rifabutin and 25-desacetyl rifabutin, despite a 50% dose reduction, is not known.

Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg three times daily) and rifampicin (600 mg once daily) decreased indinavir AUC by 92%. This effect is due to an induction of CYP3A4 by rifampicin and can result in virological failure and resistance development. The interaction with indinavir/ritonavir has not been studied. During attempts to overcome the decreased exposure by increasing the dose of other protease inhibitors with ritonavir, a high frequency of liver reactions was seen. Crixivan Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, February 2012.Rifampicin should not be coadministered with indinavir as this may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to indinavir or the class of protease inhibitors or other coadministered antiretroviral agents. Coadministration of rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 8 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily for 7 days) to 12 subjects resulted in decreases in indinavir Cmax and AUC of 87% and 92% respectively. Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, April 2012.The safety and efficacy of a higher dose of indinavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) with rifampicin (and 2 NRTIs) was studied in Thai patients. Indinavir pharmacokinetics were obtained at week 2 and trough concentrations were determined at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Indinavir/ritonavir was reduced to the Thai standard of 400/100 mg twice daily after discontinuation of rifampicin with trough concentrations being obtained at least 4 weeks after dose reduction. Geometric mean (90% CI) indinavir AUC at week 2 was 8.11 (5.56-11.82) mg/L.h. Geometric mean (90% CI) trough concentration at week 2 was 0.03 (0.02-0.04) mg/L. Geometric mean trough concentration after stopping rifampicin and subsequent dose reduction was 0.68 mg/L (p=0.004). Rifampicin had a significant effect on indinavir concentrations resulting in suboptimal concentrations, despite which the majority of patients had undetectable viral load (<50 copies/ml).

Avihingsanon A, van der Lugt, Singphore U, et al. 5th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention, Cape Town, July 2009, abstract TUPEB144.A study was performed in 6 HIV+ patients to evaluate whether the inducing effect of rifampicin could be overcome by the inhibitory effect of ritonavir. Pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed at steady stated following administration of indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) before and after administration of rifampicin (300 mg once daily for 4 days). Reductions in median concentrations were seen 12 h after the last dose of rifampicin; indinavir concentrations reduced by 87% (from 837 to 112 ng/ml) and ritonavir concentrations by 94% (from 431 to 27 ng/ml). These results strongly indicate that the administration of rifampicin with indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) could lead to subtherapeutic concentrations of indinavir.

Several such regimens are in clinical practice. Ritonavir decreases hepatic clearance of indinavir increasing the half life and results in an increase in indinavir trough concentrations with a small effect on Cmax. Where possible therapeutic drug monitoring should be used to ensure appropriate plasma concentrations of indinavir.The appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established. Preliminary clinical data suggest that indinavir 400 mg in combination with ritonavir 100 mg, both administered orally twice daily, may be an alternative dosing regimen. A boosted dose of 800 mg indinavir/100 mg ritonavir twice daily results in increased risk of adverse events.

Coadministration with ritonavir 200 mg increased indinavir AUC by 266% and Cmin by 24-fold; ritonavir AUC increased by 96% and Cmin increased by 371%. Coadministration with ritonavir 400 mg increased indinavir AUC by 220% and Cmin by 24-fold; ritonavir AUC was unchanged. Coadministration of a lower dose of indinavir (400 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (400 or 100 mg twice daily) was also compared to historical data from indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily). Coadministration with ritonavir 400 mg increased indinavir AUC by 68% and Cmin by 10-fold; there was no effect on ritonavir concentrations. Coadministration with ritonavir 100 mg resulted in AUC and Cmin values for indinavir that were comparable to the reference regimen. Indinavir should not be given with ritonavir to patients with decompensated liver disease as ritonavir is principally metabolised and eliminated by the liver.Crixivan Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, February 2012.Compared to historical data in patients who received indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours alone, twice-daily coadministration to volunteers of indinavir 800 mg and 100 mg ritonavir with food for two weeks resulted in an 2.7-fold increase of indinavir AUC, a 1.6-fold increase in Cmax, and an 11-fold increase in Cmin. Following a 200 mg ritonavir dose, there was a 3.6-fold increase of indinavir AUC, a 1.8-fold increase in Cmax, and a 24-fold increase in Cmin. In the same study, twice-daily coadministration of indinavir (800 mg) and ritonavir (100 mg) resulted in increases in ritonavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 61%, 72% and 62% respectively; increases following a 200 mg ritonavir dose were 19%, 96% and 4.7-fold for ritonavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin respectively. The appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established. Preliminary clinical data suggest that the incidence of nephrolithiasis is higher in patients receiving indinavir in combination with ritonavir than those receiving indinavir 800 mg every 8 h. Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, April 2012.Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased indinavir AUC by 178%, based on cross-study comparison to indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily); ritonavir AUC increased by 72%. Coadministration of indinavir (400 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) had no effect on indinavir AUC but increased Cmin by 4-fold (based on cross-study comparison to indinavir alone (800 mg three daily); ritonavir AUC and Cmin were unchanged. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of indinavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established. Minimal benefit of ritonavir-mediated pharmacokinetic enhancement is achieved with doses higher than 100 mg twice daily. In cases of co-administration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and indinavir (800 mg twice daily) caution is warranted as the risk of nephrolithiasis may be increased. Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, September 2016.Coadministration of ritonavir (400 mg twice daily for 15 days) and indinavir (400 mg twice daily for 15 days) with food was studied in 10 subjects. Effects were assessed relative to indinavir alone (800 mg every 8 hours) given under fasting conditions. On day 15, indinavir AUC decreased by 7%, Cmax decreased by 62%, and Cmin increased 4-fold.

611,Indinavir (IDV),Rocuronium,Potential Interaction,Very Low,Coadministration has not been studied. Rocuronium is mostly cleared in the bile although up to 30% may be excreted renally. P-glycoprotein was shown to mediate biliary excretion of rocuronium in a rat model.  Indinavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease rocuronium biliary elimination. Monitor clinical effect and decrease rocuronium dosage if needed.,(See Summary)
612,Indinavir (IDV),Roflumilast,Potential Weak Interaction,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Roflumilast is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 to form roflumilast N-oxide, with both roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide having PDE4 inhibitory activity. Roflumilast N-oxide is subsequently dealkylated by CYP3A4. Coadministration with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) increased roflumilast exposure by 2 fold with no significant effect on roflumilast N-oxide exposure. These changes did not translate into significant changes in the inhibitory effect on PDE4 and did not affect the known safety and tolerability profile of roflumilast. A comparable effect may occur with indinavir/ritonavir, although the magnitude of the interaction may be less pronounced given that ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4 but also induces CYP1A2. No a priori dosage adjustment is recommended.",(See Summary)

615,Indinavir (IDV),Rosuvastatin,Potential Interaction,Very Low,"Concomitant use of indinavir with rosuvastatin is not recommended. No clinical data are available, but coadministration is likely to increase rosuvastatin concentrations.  However, based on data with another boosted PI (lopinavir/ritonavir), a dose modification of rosuvastatin may be required. This is due to competition for uptake with the liver such that PLASMA concentrations of rosuvastatin may be increased but LIVER concentrations decreased, resulting in a decreased lipid lowering effect. Titrate the rosuvastatin dose carefully and use the lowest necessary dose with careful monitoring. Increase the dose as required, due to the potential impaired lipid response. ","The interaction with indinavir or indinavir/ritonavir had not been studied. Based on an interaction study with lopinavir/ritonavir, combination of rosuvastatin and protease inhibitors is not recommended.

Patients should be advised to report promptly any symptoms to their doctors. The results of one published study in HIV-infected men (n=6) indicated that coadministration of indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours chronically) with a single 25 mg dose of sildenafil resulted in an 11% increase in average AUC0-8h of indinavir and a 48% increase in average indinavir peak concentration (Cmax) compared to 800 mg every 8 hours alone.

Sildenafil was initiated at 25 mg once daily (for 7 days) and doses increased to obtain therapeutic concentrations, first to 25 mg twice daily (for 14 days) and then to 25 mg three times daily. AUC 0-8 h for the once daily, twice daily and three time daily regimens were 590, 518 and 800 ng/ml.h, respectively; corresponding Cmax values were 154, 159 and 183 ng/ml. Sildenafil mean half life in these subjects was 1.9 h compared to 2.6-3.1 h in the HIV+ subject. In order to achieve therapeutic concentrations, this patient had to be treated with a higher dose than the current recommendations of 25mg every 24 h or 48 h. The authors suggest that long term use of ritonavir may have resulted in delayed induction of PXR (and subsequently CYP3A4) in this patient.

632,Indinavir (IDV),Sitagliptin,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated in urine as unchanged drug (active secretion by OAT3, OATP4C1, P-gp) and metabolism by CYP3A4 represents a minor elimination pathway. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Indinavir/ritonavir could potentially increase sitagliptin concentrations. However, this increase may not be clinically significant as the drug is mainly eliminated unchanged and has a large safety window.

Coadministration of sorafenib and ritonavir in patients with Kaposi sarcoma did not significantly alter the exposure of sorafenib, however, a decrease in sorafenib-N-oxide (CYP3A4 mediated metabolite) was noted. The study had to be terminated early due to poor tolerance, which could possibly be related to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir leading to the formation of more toxic metabolites. Use with caution if coadministered due to poor tolerability.","Coadministration of sorafenib with ritonavir was studied in patients with Kaposi sarcoma in a parallel study. One cohort consisted of patients receiving ritonavir (n=8), and the other of patients not receiving ritonavir (n=2). Those on ritonavir received 200 mg of sorafenib once daily, and those not on ritonavir, 200 mg sorafenib twice daily. Sorafenib AUC was unaffected by ritonavir coadministration, but a decreasing trend in sorafenib-N-oxide (CYP3A4 metabolite) AUC was noted. Sorafenib was poorly tolerated, and the study terminated early. The authors suggest that ritonavir may contribute to sorafenib toxicity by inhibition of CYP3A4, shunting of metabolism towards other pathways yielding more toxic metabolites that could possibly explain the toxicity observed.

680,Indinavir (IDV),Thiopental,No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. The isoenzymes involved in thiopental metabolism have not been identified. Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the duration of surgical anaesthesia or sleep time after thiopental injection in animals. Thiopental action does not appear to be limited by metabolism, but is determined by slow thiopental release from fat deposits. There is therefore little potential for indinavir to affect thiopental exposure via enzyme inhibition.

745,Indinavir (IDV),Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. Inhibition of CYP3A by indinavir is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known. However, no effect of antiretroviral therapy on the response to vitamin D supplementation was found in a PK modelling study.","Pharmacokinetic modelling of vitamin D3 supplementation from 422 HIV-infected patients showed no significant differences in concentrations of 25-hydroxycolecalciferol related to antiretroviral drugs.Vitamin D3 supplementation scheme in HIV-infected patients based upon pharmacokinetic modelling of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol.

Coadministration with ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased eletriptan Cmax and AUC by 2.7 and 5.9 fold, respectively. The US product label for eletriptan contraindicates its use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors whereas the European product label advises that it should not be used with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.",(See Summary)
751,Indinavir (IDV),Retinol (Vitamin A) [alone],No Interaction Expected,Very Low,"Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. A clinical study demonstrated that ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir increased the activity of retinal dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Enhanced retinal dehydrogenase activity by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term.","A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

Trastuzumab does not undergo CYP mediated metabolism, however, DM1 (an active component of emtansine) is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration is not recommended due to the potential for an increase in DM1 exposure and toxicity. Consider switching to an antiretroviral regimen with no inhibitory effects on CYP3A4. If coadministration is unavoidable, consider delaying trastuzumab emtansine treatment until the antiretroviral drug is cleared from the circulation (approximately 4 elimination half-lives), if possible.
