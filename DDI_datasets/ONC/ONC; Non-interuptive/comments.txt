NON-INTERRUMPTIVE

"In addition, panelists were asked to evaluate any exceptions to memberships of drug classes based on
 literature evidence. A consensus meeting was held by conference call to discuss panelistsâ€™ ratings on 
 the interaction. 
These ratings were analyzed for consensus; those interactions that did not have a clear vote were re-rated
 by the panelists by providing them with additional literature evidence and comments from other panelists to
 help ascertain their decision. The final ratings helped determine the set of low-priority interactions that 
 can be safely generated as non-interruptive alerts in EHR. "

Evidence level

"Recommendations and considerations of the panel resulted in the creation of a list of 33 class-based
 low-priority DDI that do not warrant being interruptive alerts in EHR."
