### Clinical significance
"We identified a minimum starter set of DDIs which should be classified in all medication KBs as high severity and implemented for decision support in all EHRs."

### Management
"This set of DDIs forms a clinically important set of contraindicated drug pairs that
providers should always be alerted for."

### Evidence level
+ "We observed that most of the available literature was in the form of documented case reports or clinical studies with drugs belonging to other closely related drug families, or package inserts."
+ "The information contained in these package inserts is often incorrect or too conservative for use to assign DDIs in a KB. Moreover, these interactions are not updated regularly to reflect current knowledge. "
