ONC HIGH PRIORITY

"We identified a minimum starter set of DDIs which should be classified in all medication KBs as
 high severity and implemented for decision support in all EHRs."
Clinical significance

"This set of DDIs forms a clinically important set of contraindicated drug pairs that
providers should always be alerted for."
Management

"Future work must also focus on the identification of DDIs that exist in KBs but are not 
sufficiently corroborated by evidence, so that they can safely be omitted 
from generating alerts and hence have a more palpable impact on alert fatigue."

*****Lack of primary literature supporting the evidence for DDIs*****

"We observed that most of the available literature was in the form of documented case reports or
 clinical studies with drugs belonging to other closely related drug families, or package inserts."

"Thus, more often than necessary, KB providers have to rely on package inserts to make
determinations on DDIs, which may result in overestimating the severity of a large majority
of drug interactions."

Evidence level


"The DDIs that are in the final list identified by the panel represent a very small proportion, 
probably <0.2%, of DDI alerts that are generated in clinical practice.
