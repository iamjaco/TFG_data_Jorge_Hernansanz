DDI-MedLine.d86.s5.p0$Sirolimus$DB00877$drug$Diltiazem$DB00343$true$mechanism$drug$RESULTS: The geometric mean (90% confidence interval) whole blood sirolimus area under the plasma concentration time-curve increased 60% (35%-90%)	 from 736 to 1178 ng x h/mL	 and maximum concentration increased 43% (14%-81%)	 from 67 to 96 ng/mL	 with diltiazem coadministration	 whereas the mean elimination half-life of sirolimus decreased slightly	 from 79 to 67 hours. 																									
DDI-MedLine.d86.s6.p2$Sirolimus$DB00877$drug$Diltiazem$DB00343$true$mechanism$drug$Apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of sirolimus decreased with 38% and 45%	 respectively	 when sirolimus was given with diltiazem. 																													
DDI-MedLine.d86.s8.p0$Diltiazem$DB00343$drug$Sirolimus$DB00877$true$mechanism$drug$CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose diltiazem coadministration leads to higher sirolimus exposure	 presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of sirolimus. 																														
DDI-MedLine.d86.s9.p0$Sirolimus$DB00877$drug$Diltiazem$DB00343$true$advise$drug$Because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the sirolimus-diltiazem interaction	 whole blood sirolimus concentrations should be monitored closely in patients treated with the two drugs.
