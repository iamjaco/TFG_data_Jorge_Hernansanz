**Background**: Drug interactions (DDI) are a common characteristic of adverse drug reactions (ADR)
and suppose an emerging threat to public health. DDI data remains disperse and its integration into a
unique source can benefit other research for an easier access to data.


**Methods**: We generated a complete compendium of DDI data through the integration of 15 publicly
available database sources, and a recollection of the different DDI features (Clinical significance, evi-
dence level, management options, mechanism of action, and side effects). We looked to the overall
overlap of the DDIs and we analyzed each source by looking to its drug and DDIs. Finally, we performed
a network cluster analysis with our compendium to a drug combination clinical data in order to find
significant DDI in clinical data according to the clinical significance information obtained from the
sources.

**Results**: Across our databases, there are 4,288 unique drugs and 2,560648 unique DDIs. We con-
cluded a limited overlap of DDIs between our sources, and observed a bias for some of the ATC class
in specific databases focused on cardiovascular, HIV, Hepatitis and Cancer drugs. We found two highly
connected clusters from the network analysis performed on the drug combination clinical data.

**Conclusion**: There is little overlap between the different databases, indicating thus the sparsity infor-
mation across DDI interaction databases. Disease-specific databases contains limited DDI information
of certain drug classes. A network analysis approach was used for elucidating clinically significant DDI
(major, moderate and minor) in hospital clinical data from Denmark.
